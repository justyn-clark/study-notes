`d3.select` – a jQuery-like selector that takes a class or an id as a target.

## Methods

`.append` – adds something to the end of a selection

`.insert` – inserts something at a specific position inside a selection

`.remove` – removes a selected element from the DOM

`.attr` – read, add or modify any attribute within a selection

`.classed` – gives a class to a selected element. To work with more than one class, use an object

	.classed({
		'class1': true,
		'item': false
	})

`.style` – add a set of styles to an element. Adds directly as an attribute (style="")

`.data` – allows you to supply data to a logic structure and then loop through it. E.g. 

	var colors = ['blue', 'black'];
	
	d3.selectAll('.item')
		.data(colors)
		.style({
      		'color': function(d) {
				return d;
      		}

`.enter` – creates a sub-selection and allows you to work on it in isolation. You must select the items that are created in the `enter` predictively. Check out the example to better understand this.
