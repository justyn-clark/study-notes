# UnitTest â€“ Python Unit testing framework

`unittest` supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the tests from the reporting framework.

To achieve this, unittest supports some important concepts:

### Test Fixture
A test fixture represents the preparation needed to perform one or more tests, and any associate cleanup actions. This may involve, for example, creating temporary or proxy databases, directories, or starting a server process.

### Test Case
A test case is the smallest unit of testing. It checks for a specific response to a particular set of inputs. unittest provides a base class, TestCase, which may be used to create new test cases.

### Test Suite
A test suite is a collection of test cases, test suites, or both. It is used to aggregate tests that should be executed together.

### Test Runner
A test runner is a component which orchestrates the execution of tests and provides the outcome to the user. The runner may use a graphical interface, a textual interface, or return a special value to indicate the results of executing the tests.


The test case and test fixture concepts are supported through the `TestCase` and `FunctionTestCase` classes; the former should be used when creating new tests, and the latter can be used when integrating existing test code with a unittest-driven framework.

When building test fixtures using TestCase, the `setUp()` and `tearDown()` methods can be overridden to provide initialization and cleanup for the fixture. With FunctionTestCase, existing functions can be passed to the constructor for these purposes

When the test is run, the fixture initialization is run first; if it succeeds, the cleanup method is run after the test has been executed, regardless of the outcome of the test.

Each instance of the `TestCase` will only be used to run a single test method, so a new fixture is created for each test.
