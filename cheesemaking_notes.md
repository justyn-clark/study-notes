# Cheesemaking Notes

### Milk

All milk is made up of sugars, fat, protein, minerals, vitamins and enzymes.

##### Milk Sugar

Milk sugar provides food for the bacteria in the starter culture which is added to the milk. The starter culture digests the sugar and produces acid. This acid production begins the process that will eventually turn the milk into cheese. 

Learning to regulate this acid production is key to making great cheese.

The sugar in milk is called `lactose`. Lactose is made up of `glucose` and `galactose`. 

It is the breakdown and consumption of `lactose` that produces acid - `lactic acid`. Without the presence of acid, the production of cheese does not occur.

Enzymes act upon other substances to break a bond. The enzyme `lactase` is required to break the `lactose` into digestible sugars.

During cheesemaking, `lactose` is broken down through the actions of certain bacteria, which are usually added to the milk in the form of a starter culture. 

As the bacteria consumes the milk sugars through the process of fermentation - first `lactose`, then `glucose` and `galactose` - lactic acid is produced. 

##### Fermentation defined

Fermentation is the process through which carbohydrates and sugars are broken down into by-products such as alcohol, the gas carbon dioxide, and organic acids. The definition for the type of fermentation occurring, which is based on what is being fermented, is called the `substrate`. Fermentation is one of the oldest methods of preserving food, next to drying and salting.

##### Lactic Acid a.k.a. Lactate

The term `lactate` is used interchangeably with `lactic acid` (i.e. `lactate` == `lactic acid`). It is not to be confused with the verb `lactate.`

There are two variations of `lactic acid`, and it is the **starter culture** that can produce one or both of these types.

The two varieties of `lactate` are `D-lactate` and `L-lactate`. 

`D-lactate` can also create two other by-products that influence cheese making: the alcohol `ethanol` and the gas `carbon dioxide` (used in making Swiss cheese). 

In addition to fermenting `lactose` into two types of `lactic acid`, starter bacteria also vary in their ability to ferment the two simple sugars, `galactose` and `glucose`. If only one of the  two is completely fermented, residual sugar will remain in the cheese curd. This remaining sugar can help feed other bacteria during the first stages of aging, which is desirable in some cheeses.

For most pressed cheeses all sugar will have been metabolized and utilized after about two weeks of aging. 

There is virtually no `lactose` left in aged cheeses, so lactose intolerant people can happily consume it. In fresher and more moist cheeses, it is more likely that some `lactose` will exist, so lactose intolerant people should not consume them.

The later an animal is in her lactation cycle, the less lactose there is in her milk, and the more protein and fat there is. This can influence the rate at which acid is developed by the starter culture, as there is simply less fuel for the process.

##### Crystals ("Crunchies") in Cheese

There are a couple of types of crystals that can occur in cheese, and are known as the **crunchies**. The first type is formed from the amino acid `tyrosine` and is desireable is certain cheeses. `Tyrosine` crystals typically form in high-protein, long-aged cheeses such as Parmesan and aged Gouda. 

The second type of crystal is formed when calcium combines with `residual lactate` to form `calcium lactate crystals` - which are considered a **defect**, and are commonly found on the surface of cheeses like cheddar.

##### Milk Fat - Filling Out The Flavor

The role of Milk fat is to provide an appealing texture, well-rounded flavor, and wonderful aromas. The amount, composition, and quality of milk fat in cheese are all important factors to the cheesemaking process, and can be somewhat manipulated by the cheesemaker.
