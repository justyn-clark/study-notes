# HTML5

#### What is the Doctype and what does it do

A Doctype triggers standards mode (or Quirks Mode) in the browser. The HTML5 doctype is very streamlined.

#### What is the difference between session storage, local storage and cookies

**Local Storage**, **Session Storage** and **Cookies** are all client storage solutions. 

Session data is held on the server where it remains under your direct control. **Session Storage** (as the name persists) is only available for the duration of the browser session (and is deleted when the window is closed) - it does however survive page reloads.

**Cookies** are slow, insecure (sent over the server), and limited to about 4KB of data. 

**Local Storage**, or **Web Storage** stores key name pairs locally within the browser, and is faster, more secure (not sent over the server) and has a limit of 5MB of data.

There is also **WebSQL** and **IndexedDB** - local browser databases. WebSQL is no longer supported, and IndexedDB is supported in most browsers, but still a contentious issue.

#### What is the difference between XHTML and HTML5

* XHTML does not have good browser support
* HTML5 uses more semantic code
* IE and other user agents cannot parse XHTML as XML
* HTML5 has offline storage
