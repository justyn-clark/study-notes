Public and Private Keys:

You can give your public key to anyone in the world. Then if you authenticate into their system, you must use your private key to get it. It means that you are definitely you.

But if someone send you a document that has been encrypted with your public key, only you will be able to decrypt it with you private key.

So you going to somewhere else is authentication, and anyone sending you something is encryption.
