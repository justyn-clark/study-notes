#Virtual Box

##Terminology
**Host operating system (host OS):** This is the operating system of the physical computer on which VirtualBox was installed.

**Guest operating system (guest OS):** This is the operating system that is running inside the virtual machine

**Virtual machine (VM):** This is the special environment that VirtualBox creates for your guest operating system while it is running.

**Guest Additions:** This refers to special software packages which are shipped with VirtualBox but designed to be installed inside a VM to improve performance of the guest OS and to add extra features.

##Virtual Box Features
Whereas a “bare-metal” or “type 1” hypervisor would run directly on the hardware, VirtualBox requires an existing operating system to be installed. It can thus run alongside existing applications on that host.

To a very large degree, VirtualBox is functionally identical on all of the host platforms, and the same ﬁle and image formats are used. This allows you to run virtual machines created on one host on another host with a different host operating system; for example, you can create a virtual machine on Windows and then run it under Linux.

Guest Additions provide for “shared folders”, which let you access ﬁles from the host system from within a guest machine.
