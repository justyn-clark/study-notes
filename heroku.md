#Heroku

##Overview
Heroku lets you deploy, run and manage applications written in Ruby, Node.js, Java, Python, Clojure and Scala.

You need to employ a buildpack if you want to use another lanauges.

##Applications
Applications consist of your source code, a description of any dependencies, and a Procfile.

Dependency mechanisms vary across languages, so they are specific to Ruby, Scala, Node.js, etc

##Knowing what to execute
One requirement is informing the platform as to which parts of your application are runnable.

If youâ€™re using some established framework, Heroku can figure it out. 

For other applications, you may need to explicitly declare what can be executed in a Procfile, which lists process types - i.e. named commands that you may want executed.
