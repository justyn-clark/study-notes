## Include text at end of line on multiple lines

To add at end of line, you can use drag strategy, but it could get hairy with lines of different length.

Select all lines you want to edit. `Cmd shift l`. This turns each line into an editable area. As is, if you start typing, it will replace the whole thing.

Now click right arrow, and multi cursor will go to end of line. If you now hit `cmd left arrow`, cursor will move to beginning of line.
