# Cheesemaking Concepts

Familiar concepts in traditional cheese making include:

* preparing the milk (e.g. homogenization)
* culturing
* adding coloring and calcium chloride
* coagulation
* cutting the curd
* cooking
* stirring
* washing curd
* draining 
* pressing
* salting
* aging
* ripening

#### Choosing and Preparing Milk

1. Stay away from heavily processed milk and never use ultra-pasteurized milk. It is best to use non-homogenized milk, aka `cream top`.

2. When buying milk at the store, ask when the milk was delivered, then buy it as fresh as possible.

3. You can add cream to skim milk to mimic non-homogenized milk, but you should start with regular whole milk.

The first step is really choosing what type of animal will be providing the milk.

Another idea is to get involved in a `cow share` where you jointly own a cow or goat with others, but a 3rd party farmer takes care of the animal. In this case, you need to be extremely aware of how the animal is treated by the farmer.

##### Animal Health

Unhealthy animals (physical AND mental health) will produce lower quality milk than their healthy counterparts, and will suffer from more cases of `mastitis` (udder infection). 

Before the animal begins to suffer from `mastitis`, it will often have `subclinical mastitis`, which means you can't see any symptoms in the milk or on the udder, but they will have a high `Somatic Cell Count (SCC)` which is a count of white blood cells in the milk. High SCC means an unhealthy animal.

In healthy animals that are not stressed, you typically see a lower SCC.

##### Preserving Milk Quality During Harvest

"Milk was never meant to see the light of day". It was meant to go directly from the mama into the baby's stomach.

Every process we expose it to once it leaves the animal's udder brings a risk of reduced quality and infection.

Essentially, you want to limit its exposure to anything.

There are 4 major points re milk health to keep in mind:

1. Anticipating and preventing the contamination of milk during collection
2. Proper cleaning and sanitation of all equipment that will make contact with the milk
3. Rapid chilling of milk after collection down to refrigeration temperature within two hours after the beginning of collection
4. Prevention of contamination during holding and the shortest holding time possible

##### Heat Treatment 

Pasteurization should not be used as a band-aid for dirty or careless milking hygiene. This might make it safe but will definitely not make it taste better.

Pasteurization is meant to kill bacteria and pathogens, but may also harm advantageous parts of the milk.

The two most important side effects are the destruction of the enzyme lipase and the possible denaturing of whey proteins. 

Regular temperature pasteurization has little effect on the whey proteins, but at high temps, these proteins are altered in a manner that causes them to interact with the face of the casein micelle in a bad way, leading to a weak curd.

Since pasteurization destroys most of the milk enzyme `lipase`, it is usually added back into the milk during the cheese making process later on.

With any method of pasteurization, if cheese making is to take place immediately after, the milk is only cooled to the called for ripening temperature. 

##### Homogenization

Homogenization is a process that sends whole milk or cream under high pressure through a series of screens with restricted openings to reduce the size of the fat molecules, and change some of the proteins that help milk fat rise to the top. Homogenized milk is a poor choice for cheese making.


##### Standardization and The Balance of Protein and Fat

As a commercial cheese producer, you may sometimes need to adhere to certain restrictions re protein-to-fat ration if you call your cheese a certain name.

	# Formula for determining protein-to-fat ratio
	# Divide protein percentage by fat percentage. E.g.
	
	Milk fat = 4.25
	Protein = 3.25
	3.25 / 4.25 = 0.76
	Ratio = 0.76:1
	

##### Formula	for estimating cheese yield

	# Semihard to hard cheese formula:
	1.63 * (Fat % + Protein %) = Yield
	
	# Example
	1.63 * (4.5 + 2.8)
	= 11.899
	= 11% yield

Soft cheese yield will usually be 20 to 40 percent, depending on moisture content of the final product.

##### Where to buy cultures

* New England Cheese Supply
* Dairy Connection - Wisconsin
* Glengarry Cheese Supply - Canada
* Fromagex - Canada
* Ch. Hansen
* Danisco (Choozit)

Tips for buying cultures:

* Ignore all the frozen cultures (these are for larger producers)
* Ignore all cultures that are in sizes too big for your use (>20-50 units)
* Sort through recipes and match them with the cultures they need and then purchase those.

##### Must-Own Culture Blends

These three core culture blends are used to make almost every cheese in the G's book.

* **Fresh, feta, and surface-ripened cheeses:** - Flora Danica by Ch. Hansen
* **Semi-hard to hard aged cheeses whose curd is cooked to only 102F (39C):** MA 4000 by Choozit
* **Italian style and any cheese whose curd is cooked over 102F (39C):** Thermo B by Abiasa

This will be a very good start.

Purchase ten-unit package and then repackage them into smaller doses. This will save on costs.


##### Equipment for weighing and repackaging culture

* Gram scale reading to the tenths (should read to 0.00, preferably 0.000)
* Small, sealable ziplock bags (from lab supply or food service supply store)
* Sanitized dry measuring spoon

##### Multiple-Dose Culture Packets

Multiple-dose culture packets are almost always measured by the number of units (aka doses) that the packet contains. Packets usually come in ten and twenty unit sizes. 

Culture is sold by the number of units because when the culture is manufactured it frequently varies in strength and in its ability to acidify the milk. So each packed is filled with the same amount based on strength instead of weight.

A general rule of thumb is that 1 unit cultures 50 pounds (22 L) of milk, but this doesn't apply across the board.


##### Other Factors Influencing Dosage

If you are using raw milk, you only need to use about half the amount of starter culture that you'd use with pasteurized milk, because of the adventitious bacteria that already exist in raw milk that product acid.

Milk with higher than average protein, or milk with high somatic cell counts (SCC), and milk with lower than average lactose content will negatively affect avid development, so you may need to use a bit more culture. 

This is why it's important to know your milk AND monitor acid development through the ripening process. 

#### When and how to add the culture

The usual temp at which culture is added and milk is held during ripening is between 86F - 90F (30C - 32C).

Some acid-coagulated cheeses are ripened at lower temps, such as yoghurt.

When working with raw milk, add direct-set starter culture at 80F (27C), then continue to raise the milk temp to the goal ripening temp. This will allow the freeze-dried culture time to rehydrate before activating.

### The Cheese Making Process

#### The Process of Ripening

During ripening, the bacteria in the starter culture begins to populate the milk, consume the milk sugar (lactose), and produce lactic acid. Depending on what else occurs during the process, the ripening time must be of a length that helps, not hinders the desired acid production during the rest of the make, and the goal pH or titratable acidity (TA) at draining.

After ripening and just before coagulation, you may want to add additional ingredients like coloring (Annatto), calcium chloride, lipase, or flavored liquid from herbs, seeds, smoke or hot peppers.

#### The process of Coagulation

Once the ripening goal has been reached (time passed or acid-level change), we add the coagulant. 

Rennet (animal or microbial) comes as either liquid or a tablet. Liquid rennet is much easier to measure accurately. Liquid rennet is easier to use especially in larger cooks.

Make sure to check if the rennet (especially microbial) is single strength or double strength. Use half the requested dose if it is double strength.
