# Cheesemaking Concepts

Familiar concepts in traditional cheese making include:

* preparing the milk (e.g. homogenization)
* culturing
* adding coloring and calcium chloride
* coagulation
* cutting the curd
* cooking
* stirring
* washing curd
* draining 
* pressing
* salting
* aging
* ripening

#### Choosing and Preparing Milk

1. Stay away from heavily processed milk and never use ultra-pasteurized milk. It is best to use non-homogenized milk, aka `cream top`.

2. When buying milk at the store, ask when the milk was delivered, then buy it as fresh as possible.

3. You can add cream to skim milk to mimic non-homogenized milk, but you should start with regular whole milk.

The first step is really choosing what type of animal will be providing the milk.

Another idea is to get involved in a `cow share` where you jointly own a cow or goat with others, but a 3rd party farmer takes care of the animal. In this case, you need to be extremely aware of how the animal is treated by the farmer.

##### Animal Health

Unhealthy animals (physical AND mental health) will produce lower quality milk than their healthy counterparts, and will suffer from more cases of `mastitis` (udder infection). 

Before the animal begins to suffer from `mastitis`, it will often have `subclinical mastitis`, which means you can't see any symptoms in the milk or on the udder, but they will have a high `Somatic Cell Count (SCC)` which is a count of white blood cells in the milk. High SCC means an unhealthy animal.

In healthy animals that are not stressed, you typically see a lower SCC.
