# Cheesemaking Concepts

Familiar concepts in traditional cheese making include:

* preparing the milk (e.g. homogenization)
* culturing
* adding coloring and calcium chloride
* coagulation
* cutting the curd
* cooking
* stirring
* washing curd
* draining 
* pressing
* salting
* aging
* ripening

#### Choosing and Preparing Milk

1. Stay away from heavily processed milk and never use ultra-pasteurized milk. It is best to use non-homogenized milk, aka `cream top`.

2. When buying milk at the store, ask when the milk was delivered, then buy it as fresh as possible.

3. You can add cream to skim milk to mimic non-homogenized milk, but you should start with regular whole milk.

The first step is really choosing what type of animal will be providing the milk.

Another idea is to get involved in a `cow share` where you jointly own a cow or goat with others, but a 3rd party farmer takes care of the animal. In this case, you need to be extremely aware of how the animal is treated by the farmer.

##### Animal Health

Unhealthy animals (physical AND mental health) will produce lower quality milk than their healthy counterparts, and will suffer from more cases of `mastitis` (udder infection). 

Before the animal begins to suffer from `mastitis`, it will often have `subclinical mastitis`, which means you can't see any symptoms in the milk or on the udder, but they will have a high `Somatic Cell Count (SCC)` which is a count of white blood cells in the milk. High SCC means an unhealthy animal.

In healthy animals that are not stressed, you typically see a lower SCC.

##### Preserving Milk Quality During Harvest

"Milk was never meant to see the light of day". It was meant to go directly from the mama into the baby's stomach.

Every process we expose it to once it leaves the animal's udder brings a risk of reduced quality and infection.

Essentially, you want to limit its exposure to anything.

There are 4 major points re milk health to keep in mind:

1. Anticipating and preventing the contamination of milk during collection
2. Proper cleaning and sanitation of all equipment that will make contact with the milk
3. Rapid chilling of milk after collection down to refrigeration temperature within two hours after the beginning of collection
4. Prevention of contamination during holding and the shortest holding time possible

##### Heat Treatment 

Pasteurization should not be used as a band-aid for dirty or careless milking hygiene. This might make it safe but will definitely not make it taste better.

Pasteurization is meant to kill bacteria and pathogens, but may also harm advantageous parts of the milk.

The two most important side effects are the destruction of the enzyme lipase and the possible denaturing of whey proteins. 

Regular temperature pasteurization has little effect on the whey proteins, but at high temps, these proteins are altered in a manner that causes them to interact with the face of the casein micelle in a bad way, leading to a weak curd.

Since pasteurization destroys most of the milk enzyme `lipase`, it is usually added back into the milk during the cheese making process later on.

With any method of pasteurization, if cheese making is to take place immediately after, the milk is only cooled to the called for ripening temperature. 

##### Homogenization

Homogenization is a process that sends whole milk or cream under high pressure through a series of screens with restricted openings to reduce the size of the fat molecules, and change some of the proteins that help milk fat rise to the top. Homogenized milk is a poor choice for cheese making.
