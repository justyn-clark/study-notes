# Acid Development and Monitoring

The ability and knowledge to accurately monitoring `pH` will enable to cheesemaker to create reproducible, high-quality and safe cheese, above any other skill.

`pH neutral` means `7.0`. Anything above or below that number becomes harsher.

Things with a `pH` below `7.0` are `sour` or `acidic`. Things above `7.0` are `bitter` or `basic` (aka `alkaline`).

We are only concerned with the acidic side for cheesemaking.

Since ions have an electrical charge - acidic solutions contain positively charged hydrogen ions, while alkaline solutions contain negatively charged hydroxyl ions.  since these ions carry an electrical crate, they can be measured with a meter capable of reading the electrical potential of a solution.

`Titratable Acidity` on the other hand, measures the amount of an alkaline solution it takes to neutralize the acid, and uses that measurement to define the amount of acid present. 

`pH` does not increase or decrease in an equal fashion. It's a logarithm that is exponential. Every point lower than 7 on the pH scale is 10 times more acidic that the number before it. If you ignore the math, this means that as your cheese approaches the goal pH, even tiny decreases will make a huge difference in the amount of acid present in the curd.

#### Buffering Capacity

`Buffers` are substances that have the ability to absorb acid and resist `pH` change.

Solutions said to have a good `buggering capacity` contain a lot of these substances, and will *attempt* to prevent `pH` changes when acid is added or created. 

The buffers in milk include `casein`, `calcium phosphate` and others.

A solution with a strong `buffering capacity` will still become acidified, it just takes more acid to make that happen than a solution without a strong `buffering capacity`.

Buffering includes resisting acidic and alkaline changes, but we are only interested in the acidic side.

The `buffering capacity` of milk will change with season and species. In general, the higher the protein content of the milk, the more `buffering capacity` it has.

We discussed this when talking about needing to add extra starter culture to late-lactation animals or a breed with naturally high components, as the extra culture will help create more acid to overcome the additional `acid sponges` in high-component milk. 

This is important because the entire process of cheesemaking is one of manipulating the buffering capacity of milk through the production and absorption of acid by the curd.

##### Milk that is alkaline

Milk that is alkaline is comes from an animal that has mastitis - an udder infection. Blood cells are forced into the milk, which are slightly alkaline. You can check for a high SCC count with an inexpensive test, such as the California Mastitis Test or PortaCheck.

##### Temperature Compensation

Most `pH` meters have a built-in feature called `temperature compensation`. This feature is designed to make adjustments based on how the electrolyte solution in the meter's electrode responds to temperature changes. 

Most cheesemakers think that it is supposed to account for milk's natural response to warming (not completely correct).

You can maximize this feature by calibrating when the buffer solutions are at the same temperature as the solution you want to measure.

##### Tips on pH standards

You should attempt to measure and record pH under the same conditions. otherwise the numbers will not give you meaningful information.

When you are developing goal pH readings, it is a good idea to record the curd temperature at the same time. Consistency is the key!

It is important to develop your own standards. 

#### Mastering Measuring Acid Development

`TA` (titratable acidity) used to be the norm for checking acid development, especially in Europe, but now affordable and accurate `pH` are the preferred method. 

`pH` and `TA` (titratable acidity) are not directly related. `pH` measures the number of "free" hydrogen ions in the solution while TA measures all the ions present whether they are free or bound by buffers (those acidic "sponges" we talked about).

Since the concentration of unbound hydrogen ions is what affects other things going on during the cheesemaking process, pH is the most direct measure that concerns the cheesemaker.

##### Measuring Acid Using pH

Measuring pH is quick and allows you to check curd and finished cheeses, and it is relatively easy to find `pH` parameters for different cheese types. 

Must have features for a cheese-purposed pH meter are as follows:

* Readings to two decimal places - 0.00 instead of 0.0
* Range of 0.0 to 14.00
* Two or three-point calibration
* Waterproof

G's favorite pH meter is the `Oakton Acorn portable`.

##### When and how to check pH

* After calibrating the meter, check the pH of the milk as soon as it goes into the vat or pot
* Move the electrode gently and slowly in the solution
* It usually takes a minute to stabilize
* Write that number on a cheese make sheet
* When the milk reaches the right temp, add the culture. 
* After the recommended ripening time, repeat a pH reading
* Record the number on the log or make sheet
* Usually, you don't take the pH again until the curd has reached the right texture and it's ready to drain. 
* When checking at this stage, you are usually checking the whey, which will have a different pH than the curd
* You can form a little ball of curd and check that throughout the process. It should be pretty close
* The most important reading (according to G) is the pH level at the *end* of draining, right before pressing. The second most important is the starting pH.

Whatever you do regarding taking readings, be consistent. This way you can begin to collect information to improve your cheesemaking.

When checking milk or whey pH, it is a good idea to pull a small sample and test that.
