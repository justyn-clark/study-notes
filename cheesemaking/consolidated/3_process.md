# Consolidated: Cheese Making Process

### Room temp



### Starter Culture

The usual temp at which culture is added and milk is held during ripening is between `86F - 90F` (`30C - 32C`).

Some acid-coagulated cheeses are ripened at lower temps, such as yoghurt.

We are working with DVS - Direct Vat Set cultures. They are added by sprinkling them on top of the warm milk, letting them set for a few minutes, then stirring them thoroughly into the milk.

Letting the powder sit on top of the milk allows it time to absorb some moisture and begin to rehydrate. If it is stirred in immediately, sometimes the powder will form a clump in the milk that won't dissolve.

After ripening and just before coagulation, you may want to add additional ingredients like coloring `Annatto`, `calcium chloride`, `lipase`, or flavored liquid from herbs, seeds, smoke or hot peppers.

### Rennet

Make sure to check if the rennet (especially microbial) is single strength or double strength. Use half the requested dose if it is double strength.

Liquid rennet must be diluted in cool, non chlorinated water before use. If chlorinated water is used, the chlorine will attack the rennet. Heat will also deactivate it.

Don't mix the rennet with the water until just before use - because light exposure, contaminants, etc.

Once mixed, it is critical that the milk stop moving in the vat and remain as still as possible until coagulation is complete.

`Rennet` solution should be dispersed over the milk by pouring it over a perforated ladle or using a "garden" sprinkle can.

The stirring motion should be "up and down" instead of circular. You don't want to create a whirlpool effect.

Once you stop stirring, you can use a flat ladle to help the milk stop moving.

You should also log the time when you added the coagulant and how long you stirred it for in a logbook. This is essential for the next step.

### Cutting

The firmness of the coagulated milk when you cut it "fixes" the type of curd you will end up with later on in the make. So if you know the goal, you will know at what firmness to cut and what size to cut the curd.

The goal is a **smoothly cut curd** of the **desired size**.

#### Determining when to cut

1. Observe the milk for the point at which the enzymatic phase ends and the coagulation phase begins. I.e. observe the flocculation point, using that time to determine the total coagulation time. 

2. Watch for the ideal texture for cutting, or the `clean break`.

#### Checking for flocculation

Flocculation occurs when the enzymatic phase is 75% - 80% complete and clumping becomes noticeable.

To test for flocculation point, remove a small sample of milk in a clear container, swirl it, and see if flocks form on the sides of the container.

Once you see flocculation, the time is noted, then multiplied by a specific factor (see Table 2-2, p. 47). **The resulting number is the time from adding the coagulant to cutting.**

#### Checking for Clean Break

A clean break is a good test to use in addition to Flocculation testing, but is not a single moment in the vat. The optimal cutting time is a range, not a moment.

**Method** - Use a knife, cut a slit, insert the knife - flat side up- at an angle just behind the slit and under the uncut portion of the front of the cut. Then lift slowly and see if the cut seam expands forward. As the curd mass gives way to the pressure below, it will part. As it parts, observe the sides of the tear and the liquid that escapes. Are the sides smooth or jagged? Is the whey white or yellow/green? If the sides are smooth and the liquid is more yellow/green than white, the curd is ready to cut.

If the cut time is off from its goal, adjust the amount of rennet for the next batch.

### Cooking

Almost all hard cheeses will go through a phase where the curd is heated and stirred.

Temp increases are usually done in slow increments, with the initial increases being done the slowest to give the inside of the curd a chance to lose the whey at the same rate as the surface.

As the temp increases, the bacteria will respond by producing more or less acid, depending on the type of the starter bacteria.

Meaning, **you can adjust the rate of acid development by adjusting the temperature in the vat**.

If required, stir the curd as gently as is needed to prevent the curds from "shattering", or breaking into tiny pieces.

#### Checking the curd for readiness

Scoop a small handful of curds from the vat, flatten your hands and make a patty of curds in your hand. Drain the curd with some light squeezing, then see if the curd sticks to one hand, holding it upside down. If it sticks, it is ready.

### Pitching

`Pitching` refers letting the curds settle in the vat, sometimes just before draining but often as a technique for allowing a bit more acid development in the vat without continuing to shrink the curds through stirring.

### Draining in bags

They whey collecting below the bags should be relatively transparent and a yellow-green color, not white. It it's whitish, you know you are losing some butterfat and product

### Draining and Pressing in Forms

If the curd temp is over `75F` (`24C`), the butterfat is less stable and mostly liquid, so you have to be careful not to squeeze the fat right out of it. If you see white greasy whey, you know you are using too much pressure.

Room temp also influences drainage. Generally a `72F` (`22C`) room is ideal for draining most cheeses - it's just below the butterfat melting temp.

The cooler the room, the slower the draining and the `pH` development.

### Salting

Salt `sodium chloride`, aka table salt, slows and halts acidification, assists with drainage, controls bacteria and mold growth, influences texture, and contributes to flavor.

The best texture for cheesemaking is flaked salt, such as you find in Kosher Salt. Make sure your Kosher Salt does not contain an `anti-caking` agent. Try to find the `Diamond Crystal` brand, via `Saltworks`. 

### Methods of Salting

There are two main methods of adding salt to cheese - `dry salting` and `brine salting`.

Dry salting is done by sprinkling or rubbing salt onto the curd or formed cheese.

#### How to Brine Salt the Cheese

Ideally, cheeses are put into the brine at the same temperature as the brine - usually `46F to 59F` (`8C-15C`).

Just before placing wheels in the brine, it is a good idea to first agitate the solution to help ensure an equal distribution of minerals and contents.

Sprinkle dry salt on top of each cheese after it is floating in the brine. Otherwise, you should totally submerge the cheese in the brine using a rack that presses them down into the brine

**Table 2-4: Average Ideal Salt Levels in Cheese - p.58**

**Table 2-5: Average Brining Times Based on Cheese Type - p.60**

In general, for each `gallon (4L)` of **water**, add `1 tablespoon (15 ml)` of **calcium chloride** (of a 32% premixed solution) and `1 teaspoon (5 ml)` **white vinegar**.

If you aren't sure if your available water contains too much calcium, see if you get any sliming on the surface of the cheeses. If the cheese starts to slime, you can usually save them by scraping off the slime and adding more calcium chloride to the brine before placing the cheese back in the solution. Remember to check the pH of the brine at the same time.

 If you need to remove brine from your tank to keep it from overflowing, be sure to stir the brine well first, so you are leaving a balanced solution.

If your brine becomes too acidic, you can neutralize it a bit by adding some baking soda.

You can filter the brine through finely woven cheesecloth to remove particles and "sludge" that accumulate at the bottom of the tank.

For initial salting of cheeses, the usual level of salt to brine is about `23%` - fully saturated brine is closer to `26%` salt.

Salt should be monitored using a `salometer` (also spelled `salinometer`), aka a `brine hydrometer`.

There's an issue with how to read the `salometer`. If you want, read up on it on `p. 62`.
