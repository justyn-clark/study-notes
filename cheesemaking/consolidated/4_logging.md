# Consolidated: Logging

Log the following:

* `pH` & temp of milk at start of batch
* time when starter culture was added
* `pH` of milk at end of `ripening`
* `pH` & temp of milk at rennetting
* time when `rennet` was added
* how long you stirred it for during `rennetting`
* time when `flocculation` occurs
* time when cooking occurs, how long, what temp
* `pH` at beginning and end of draining
* `pH` of the brine
* time of placing cheese in brine and taking it out
* 



##### When and how to check pH

* After calibrating the meter, check the pH of the milk as soon as it goes into the vat or pot
* Move the electrode gently and slowly in the solution
* It usually takes a minute to stabilize
* Write that number on a cheese make sheet
* When the milk reaches the right temp, add the culture. 
* After the recommended ripening time, repeat a pH reading
* Record the number on the log or make sheet
* Usually, you don't take the pH again until the curd has reached the right texture and it's ready to drain. 
* When checking at this stage, you are usually checking the whey, which will have a different pH than the curd
* You can form a little ball of curd and check that throughout the process. It should be pretty close
* The most important reading (according to G) is the pH level at the *end* of draining, right before pressing. The second most important is the starting pH.

Whatever you do regarding taking readings, be consistent. This way you can begin to collect information to improve your cheesemaking.

When checking milk or whey pH, it is a good idea to pull a small sample and test that.
