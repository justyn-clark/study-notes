# Purchase List

* Calcium Chloride (`CaCl2`)
* California Mastits Test / PortaCheck
* Wine Cooler / Large bar fridge with thermostat

#### Equipment for weighing and repackaging culture

* Gram scale reading to the tenths (should read to 0.00, preferably 0.000)
* Small, sealable ziplock bags (from lab supply or food service supply store)
* Sanitized dry measuring spoon

#### Salometer

There's an issue with how to read the `salometer`. If you want, read up on it on `p. 62`. 

To avoid this issue, buy a salometer with a scale calibrated based on saturation by weight, instead of the percentage of salt, so that when you add `23%` salt, the salometer will read `23%`. Otherwise it will read `90%`.

Make sure you buy plastic, NOT glass

#### pH Meter

Must have features for a cheese-purposed pH meter are as follows:

Readings to two decimal places - 0.00 instead of 0.0
Range of 0.0 to 14.00
Two or three-point calibration
Waterproof
G's favorite pH meter is the Oakton Acorn portable.
