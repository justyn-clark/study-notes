###### Salometer

There's an issue with how to read the `salinometer`. If you want, read up on it on `p. 62`. 

To avoid this issue, buy a salinometer with a scale calibrated based on saturation by weight, instead of the percentage of salt, so that when you add `23%` salt, the salinometer will read `23%`. Otherwise it will read `90%`.

Make sure you buy plastic, NOT glass

Range of 0.0 to 14.00
Two or three-point calibration
Waterproof
G's favorite pH meter is the Oakton Acorn portable.
