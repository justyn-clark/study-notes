# The Cheese Making Process

#### When and how to add the culture

The usual temp at which culture is added and milk is held during ripening is between 86F - 90F (30C - 32C).

Some acid-coagulated cheeses are ripened at lower temps, such as yoghurt.

When working with raw milk, add direct-set starter culture at 80F (27C), then continue to raise the milk temp to the goal ripening temp. This will allow the freeze-dried culture time to rehydrate before activating.

We are working with `DVS` - Direct Vat Set cultures. They are added by sprinkling them on top of the warm milk, letting them set for a few minutes, then stirring them thoroughly into the milk. 

Letting the powder sit on top of the milk allows it time to absorb some moisture and begin to rehydrate. If it is stirred in immediately, sometimes the powder will form a clump in the milk that won't dissolve.

#### The Process of Ripening

During ripening, the bacteria in the starter culture begins to populate the milk, consume the milk sugar (lactose), and produce lactic acid. Depending on what else occurs during the process, the ripening time must be of a length that helps, not hinders the desired acid production during the rest of the make, and the goal `pH` or `titratable acidity` (TA) at draining.

After ripening and just before coagulation, you may want to add additional ingredients like coloring (Annatto), calcium chloride, lipase, or flavored liquid from herbs, seeds, smoke or hot peppers.

#### The process of Coagulation

Once the ripening goal has been reached (time passed or acid-level change), we add the coagulant. 

Rennet (animal or microbial) comes as either liquid or a tablet. Liquid rennet is much easier to measure accurately. Liquid rennet is easier to use especially in larger cooks.

Make sure to check if the rennet (especially microbial) is single strength or double strength. Use half the requested dose if it is double strength.

There are different amounts of rennet called for in different cheeses. Here's why:

* Temp of milk at rennetting: coagulant will work faster at slightly warmer temps, making flocculation time faster.
* pH at time of rennetting: the more acidic the milk, the faster the coagulation time
* The goal total coagulation time: This is a combination of desired texture at cutting and acid development during coagulation.

##### Dilution

Liquid rennet must be diluted in **cool, non chlorinated water** before use. If chlorinated water is used, the chlorine will attack the rennet. Heat will also deactivate it.

Don't mix the rennet with the water until just before use - because light exposure, contaminants, etc.

##### Adding the Coagulant

The style of stirring and the length of time stirring the coagulant into the milk are vital. As soon as the rennet touches the milk, it starts working. The more evenly and effectively that the rennet is incorporated into the milk, the better. 

Once mixed, it is critical that the milk stop moving in the vat and remain as still as possible until coagulation is complete.

For these reasons, rennet solution should be dispersed over the milk by pouring it over a perforated ladle or using a "garden" sprinkle can (when adding to large vats).

The stirring motion should be "up and down" instead of circular. You don't want to create a whirlpool effect, because the milk will keep moving, causing problems with coagulation.

Once you stop stirring, you can use a flat ladle to help the milk stop moving. 

You should also log the time when you added the coagulant and how long you stirred it for in a logbook. This is essential for the next step.

##### Cutting the curd

The firmness of the coagulated milk when you cut it "fixes" the type of curd you will end up with later on in the make. So if you know the goal, you will know at what firmness to cut and what size to cut the curd. 

As the coagulum sits for longer, the protein structure will become more firm and granular, so when you attempt to cut an extra-firm mass into small pieces, it will create curds with rough, granular sides with more surface area.

If the curds have a rough surface, they will lose more butterfat into the whey through the jagged parts that stick out from the main part of each curd. 

So the goal is a **smoothly cut curd of the desired size**.

##### Size of the curd

The goal of cutting the coagulated milk into evenly sized pieces (curds) is to expose an equal amount of surface area so the curds can shrink by losing whey. The more even in size you can cut the curds, the better.

The size at which curds are cut also influences fat retention. The smaller the curds, the more fat is lost, no matter the original fat content of the milk.

When you cut the curds, areas of the protein network are exposed, and the fat trapped within leaks out into the whey.

##### Determining when to cut

Here are two methods to determine when to cut the curd.

1. Observe the milk for the point at which the enzymatic phase ends and the coagulation phase begins. I.e. observe the flocculation point, using that time to determine the total coagulation time. 

2. Watch for the ideal texture for cutting, or the `clean break`.

##### What is Flocculation

A `floc` is a clumped particle. 

The enzymatic phase is when enzymes knock off the outside water-loving kappa-casein projections. Flocculation occurs when this enzymatic phase is 75 to 80 percent complete and clumping becomes noticeable.

There are several techniques for checking for flocculation.

1. You can dip a dry knife or curd blade into the milk, draw itv back out, and observe the surface for little flecks (those are flocks).

2. Float a jelly-jar lid on the surface of the milk and note when in no longer spins freely. 

3. Remove a small sample of milk in a clear container, swirl it, and see if flocks form on the sides of the container. 

By watching for flocculation, you can judge the total cut time better than by just watching for a `clean break`

Once you see flocculation, the time is noted, then multiplied by a specific factor (see Table 2-2, p. 47).

**The resulting number is the time from adding the coagulant to cutting.** 


##### How to Check for a Clean Break

A clean break is a good test to use in addition to Flocculation testing.

A clean break is not a singular moment in the vat.

Remember, the proteins are knitting together to form a network which strengthens as it grows. If you cut too soon, the structure will mush instead of cut and you will lose the fat into the whey. Alternatively, if you wait too long, it will become so firm that it will resist the knife and tear rather than cut cleanly. So the optimal cutting time is a range, not a moment.

**Methods for checking for a clean break**

1. Crook your index or middle finger, insert it into the curd up to the second knuckle and lift slowly
2. **(Preferred)** - Use a knife, cut a slit, insert the knife - flat side up- at an angle just behind the slit and under the uncut portion of the front of the cut. Then lift slowly and see if the cut seam expands forward. As the curd mass gives way to the pressure below, it will part. As it parts, observe the sides of the tear and the liquid that escapes. Are the sides smooth or jagged? Is the whey white or yellow/green? If the sides are smooth and the liquid is more yellow/green than white, the curd is ready to cut. 

If the cut time is off from its goal, adjust the amount of rennet for the next batch.

##### Cooking

Some cheeses (soft fresh cheeses and bloomy rinds) are made *without* the curd going through a phase of heating and stirring. For most of these types, the curd is held at the ripening temperature until the mass has achieved the goal acid development and textures, at which point it is ladled, scooped, or drained right into the forms. 

Almost all other hard cheeses will go through a phase where the curd is heated and stirred. This is sometimes called `scalding` instead of `cooking`. 

Increasing the temperature of the whey will cause the curds to shrink and lose more whey. If this happens too quickly, it will cause the curd surface to dry prematurely, thereby trapping whey inside the curd. As such, temp increases are usually done in slow increments, with the initial increases being done the slowest to give the inside of the curd a chance to lose the whey at the same rate as the surface.

As the temp increases, the bacteria will respond by producing more or less acid, depending on the type of the starter bacteria. 

Meaning, **you can adjust the rate of acid development by adjusting the temperature in the vat.**

##### Stirring

You generally stir the curd gently, meaning you stir the curd as gently as is needed to prevent the curds from "shattering", or breaking into tiny pieces. 

Sometimes you can stir the curd with a cheese ladle, but sometimes you'll need to shake the pot first to agitate the curds.

##### Washing the Curds

Washed curd cheese has a portion of the whey removed during the cook phase. The same, or a lesser, volume of water is then added back into the vat. When whey is removed, a good portion of milk sugar is also removed, giving the starter bacteria a little less nourishment, thus slowing their growth and acid production. This lowered acid production helps the curd retain calcium, which will lead to a more pliable texture in the finished cheese.

When water is added back into the vat, it keeps the volume of liquid the same so the curds can still move freely during stirring. It also allows more water to be absorbed into the crds (especially cool water added to warm curds), leading to higher moisture cheese. It can also help moderate the cooking of the curd. 

In general only 25% to 30% of the whey should ever be removed. 

##### Checking Curd for Readiness

You check the readiness before going to the next step - `pitching` or `draining`.

Here's a great method for checking semi-hard to hard cheese types: Scoop a small handful of curds from the vat, flatten your hands and make a patty of curds in your hand. Drain the curd with some light squeezing, then see if the curd sticks to one hand, holding it upside down. If it sticks, it is ready.

##### Pitching the curd

`Pitching` refers letting the curds settle in the vat, sometimes just before draining but often as a technique for allowing a bit more acid development in the vat without continuing to shrink the curds through stirring. 

Many recipes call for the curd to be pitched, then pressed under the whey. This helps consolidate the curd into a mass that will assume its final shape and texture in the mold with more ease.

You can use perforated stainless steel sheets upon which weights are set, or you can just use your hands, pressing the curd under the liquid whey.

### Draining and Pressing

The main goal of pressing is to achieve the right shape, a closed rind, and a proper whey drainage from the interior of the cheese. Each cheese is different re pressure, time, etc.

##### Draining in bags

This technique is mostly used for soft, spreadable cheeses such as chèvre, fromage blanc and cream cheese. They whey collecting below the bags should be relatively transparent and a yellow-green color, not white. It it's whitish, you know you are losing some butterfat and product through the cloth. Use bags that are specifically designed for draining soft cheeses. 

##### Dipping and Ladling Curds

If making a soft high-moisture curd such as for Camembert, the curd is often cut into columns, not cubes, to help drainage. Once you start ladling, you must try to get all of the curds out of the vat and into the forms as soon as possible. It should take at most 20-30 minutes. 

##### Whey Off

If you have a curd that is meant to be pressed, you will be removing a large amount of the whey from the vat before removing the curd. This process is referred to as `Whey Off`. Usually, `whey off` occurs after the curd has been `pitched`, either via a tap with a mesh filter on it, or by just tipping the whole pot.

##### Texturing

`Texturing` usually refers to an internal change of structure that alters the final texture of the cheese. E.g. kneading the curd during heating with Mozzarella.

##### Choosing Forms

Make sure you choose a form that is appropriate for the cheese you are making. Many cheeses have an ideal diameter-to-height ratio, so you must choose a form that duplicates these proportions. About the only cheeses that can be taller than they are wide are bandaged cheddars and blues. 

#### Draining and Pressing in Forms

Soft, high-moisture curds will not need more than their own weight and the right room temp to drain and shape up, but the drier curds will need more pressure. 

If the curd temp is over 75F (24C), the butterfat is less stable and mostly liquid, so you have to be careful not to squeeze the fat right out of it. If you see white greasy whey, you know you are using too much pressure. Alternatively, if the curds cool too much, they will repel each other and not knit well into a wheel - unless you apply the right amount of pressure. 

Room temp also influences drainage. Generally a 72F (22C) room is ideal for draining most cheeses - it's just below the butterfat melting temp. 

The room temp can be dropped later in pressing, once the goal shape and moisture level have been achieved, to slow acid development if needed. 

##### The Role of Cheesecloth

The job of cheesecloth is not only to hold loose curds in the form, but to assist whey move to drainage holes in the mold. The fewer the holes, the more important this job becomes. If the cloth weave is too open for the texture of the curd, curd bits will plug the holes. It is important to prepare the cloth before placing the curd in the form. This is best done by rinsing the sanitized cloths with some warm whey from the vat. Doing this rinses chemicals away and puts the cloth at roughly the same `pH` as the curd. 

Toward the very end of pressing, the cloths may be removed from some type sod cheeses so that any pattern from the form (e.g. basket weave form) can be embossed on the surface. 

##### How much pressure to use

As much as it takes. You need only apply as much pressure as it takes to attain the goal moisture, acidity and shape of your ideal cheese.

##### Time and Temperature

The time it takes to press a cheese is closely ties to the temperature of the cheese during pressing. The `pH` at the beginning of draining, compared to the goal `pH` at the end of draining, will influence how warm you will want the cheese to stay. The cooler the room, the slower the draining and the `pH` development. If you need to delay the time when the cheese needs to be moved to the brine (or otherwise salted), you can cool the room or move the cheese to a cooler location. 

Re texture, if the cheese cools too rapidly, the curd will not knit as well and mechanical openings in the cheese will be more likely.

As a rule of thumb, 72F (22C) is an ideal room temperature during this phase 

### The Essentials of Salting

Salt (`sodium chloride`, aka table salt) slows and halts acidification, assists with drainage, controls bacteria and mold growth, influences texture, and contributes to flavor. 

The goal amounts of salt listed in the recipes are for pure sodium chloride. Sea and mined salts (i.e. regular table salts) often contain visible elements that are not desirable in your cheese. The texture of salts matter too. Rock and large crystal salts will not dissolve evenly. Extra fine ground slat is too fine for most cheeses and will dissolve and run off the cheese along with the whey.

The best texture for cheesemaking is flaked slat, such as you find in kosher salt. Some kosher salt contains an anti-caking agent that is not ideal for cheesemaking. The best brand of kosher salt to use is `Diamond Crystal` kosher salt, because it is completely free of additives. `Sonoma Kosher` is also good, and can be purchased through SaltWorks. If the recipe calls for fine slat, use canning salt (free of additives) or just grind kosher salt to be the desired texture. 

#### Methods of Salting

There are two main methods of adding salt to cheese - `dry salting` and `brine salting`. Often the method used is the personal preference of the cheesemaker, but sometimes its is best to use one method over the other.

##### How to Dry Salt the Cheese

Dry salting is done by sprinkling or rubbing salt onto the curd or formed cheese. When salt is added to the curd, it must be given a period of time to melt and begin to be absorbed. This is called `mellowing`. If mellowing is not carried out properly, there can be problems with the curd.

##### How to Brine Salt the Cheese

Ideally, cheeses are put into the brine at the same temperature as the brine - usually 46F to 59F (8C-15C). This helps prevent shocking the exterior of the cheeses, and reduces permeability of the rind to the brine (like splashing ice water on your face). Temperature also affect the uptake of salt into the cheese. 

Just before placing wheels in the brine, it is a good idea to first agitate the solution to help ensure an equal distribution of minerals and contents. 

Make sure there is enough room in the brine for the cheeses to float freely. Also, sprinkle dry salt on top of each cheese after it is floating in the brine. Otherwise, you should totally submerge the cease in the brine using a rack that presses them down into the brine - though this method can leave marks.

It is preferable to agitate the solution during brining, but this hasn't been seen to give a marked benefit.

The higher the fat content of the cheese, the slower the uptake of salt will be. 

**Table 2-4: Average Ideal Salt Levels in Cheese** - p.58

**Table 2-5: Average Brining Times Based on Cheese Type** - p.60

##### Making Brine

A well made and maintained brine can last almost indefinitely. It is difficult to get rid of brine, because most regulatory bodies consider it a pollutant.

Fresh brine is made using water, salt (`sodium chloride`), `calcium chloride` and vinegar.

Calcium chloride is added to mimic the mineral balance in the cheese. 

The goal is to maintain the brine `pH` so that it matches that of the cheeses (see `Appendix C` for common brine concentrations).

In general, for each `gallon (4L)` of **water**, add `1 tablespoon (15 ml)` of **calcium chloride** (of a 32% premixed solution) and `1 teaspoon (5 ml)` **white vinegar**.

Some cheesemakers use whey instead of water as a brine, since whey has a calcium content and is similar to pH in cheeses, but it is not recommended.

If you aren't sure if your available water contains too much calcium, see if you get any sliming on the surface of the cheeses. If the cheese starts to slime, you can usually save them by scraping off the slime and adding more calcium chloride to the brine before placing the cheese back in the solution. Remember to check the `pH` of the brine at the same time.

##### Maintaining Brine

A well-maintained brine should keep its mineral and pH balance. Each cheese that is brined will lose whey and calcium into the solution. If you are consistently brining similar types of cheese, your brine is more likely to be stable. If you brine cheeses over a range of finished `pH` levels (e.g. feta - low pH, gouda - high pH) your brine will fluctuate.

Routinely check the salt concentration and the pH.

The brine volume will increase by the loss of whey from the cheeses. If you need to remove brine from your tank to keep it from overflowing, be sure to stir the brine well first, so you are leaving a balanced solution.

If your brine becomes too acidic, you can neutralize it a bit by adding some baking soda.

For initial salting of cheeses, the usual level of salt to brine is about `23%` - fully saturated brine is closer to `26%` salt.

Brine concentration is almost always measured at `60F (16C)`, but since most brine is stored at a lower temp, this must be taking into account.

Brine must be maintained to prevent bacterial growth, keep proper salt/calcium balance as well as proper pH and to prevent off-flavors. 

In commercial-scale manufacturing plants, brine is continuously passed through a filter and ultraviolet (UV) purification system to ensure the brine remains free from bacteria, yeasts and molds.. The water passes through strong UV, which kills microorganisms. 

At home, you can filter the brine through finely woven cheesecloth to remove particles and "sludge" that accumulate at the bottom of the tank.

##### Measuring Salt in Brine

Salt should be monitored using a `salometer` (also spelled `salinometer`), aka a `brine hydrometer` to determine the salt content of a sample of whey. You can get digital, but floating bubble types work just fine and are less expensive.

There's an issue with how to read the `salometer`. If you want, read up on it on `p. 62`. 

To avoid this issue, buy a salometer with a scale calibrated based on saturation by weight, instead of the percentage of salt, so that when you add `23%` salt, the salometer will read `23%`. Otherwise it will read `90%`.

Make sure you buy plastic, NOT glass, so you don't have to worry about shattered glass in your brine. 

##### Problems with Brine

Slimy ropey brine is not too common. If it occurs, it is usually not a food safety issue, but it is gross. Usually good brine maintenance techniques will keep you in the clear. Read up on it on `p. 63`

##### Brine Maintenance Tips

1. Do you see salt at the bottom? If not add more slat (at `55F - 13C`).

2. Does it smell nice or like strong cheese? If its too strong, its time to make some fresh

3. Are there little chances of cheese floating on a white sludge at the bottom of the tank? If so, filter through a cheesecloth

4. Have you added calcium chloride lately? If you use the brine frequently, you will need to refresh the calcium level periodically.

5. How is the pH? If it is too low, you can make a partial new batch or add a bit of baking soda. If you haven't added calcium chloride lately, try that first, as it will have a slight buffering affect.

6. How long has this brine been in use? If its over 6 months and still smells nice, consider putting it in a pot on the stove and pasteurizing it. If it doesn't smell so good, you should have caught that is question 2!! ;)
