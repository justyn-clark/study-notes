# Affinage

`affinage` is a French word the means ***the art of making cheese***.

A person who specializes in `affinage` is called an `affineur`.

## The Home Cheese Cellar

#### Using a Wine Cooler

G started with a wine cooler for very small amounts of cheese. Then she upgraded to a modified refrigerator.

Wine coolers are excellent for aging cheese - they keep the temperature at 50F - 57f (10C - 14C), which is perfect for cheese. Unlike most fridges, they don't have fans, so they also tend to keep more moisture in the air, which is also perfect for cheese.

Get a wine cooler that stores 20 - 50 bottles. You can take the wine shelves out of the wine cooler and replace them with bakers racks.

While temp is maintained automatically by the wine cooler, you'll have to monitor and maintain `humidity`.  

A simple and effective way to maintain humidity is to hang a moistened terry cloth towel over the lowest shelf in the unit or on the shelves in the door, monitor the humidity, and remoisten as necessary. 

Open the door daily to provide some fresh air for your living breathing cheeses. You can do this at the same time as checking the humidity and turning the cheeses).

> **If any ammonia odors or mustiness develops, you know that your cheeses are not getting enough fresh air!**


#### Using a Refrigerator

Get a fridge that doesn't have a freezer compartment. They are more energy efficient (no freezer to maintain) and they usually don't have fans that would otherwise dry out the cheese.

Make sure to get one with coated wire shelves, not glass shelves!

Glass shelves do not allow adequate air circulation around your cheeses and will accumulate condensation on the undersides of the cheeses that could drip below. 

For about $60 you can buy a special thermostat (designed for beer brewers wanting to convert a fridge or freezer to a fermentation unit).

To operate it, you plug the fridge into the thermostat, plug the thermostat into the outlet, set the dial to the desired temp, and then insert the temp probe into the appliance (usually through the door, which can usually be closed without a problem). 

The thermostat then turns the appliance on and off as needed to maintain the temp. 

**This causes no harm to the appliance**

As with the wine cooler, you can simply increase humidity by hanging a moistened towel or sheeting on a lower shelf so that it doesn't drip on cheeses. 

*Freezers are never good unit to use for cheese aging.*

#### Using a humidified or a small fan

With wine coolers or fridges, if hanging a towel doesn't maintain humidity well enough, you can use a small electric ultrasonic humidifier. Be sure to watch for moisture buildup on the walls and any dripping. 

If you are waxing or otherwise coating your cheeses (or vacuum sealing them), humidity is not important for their proper aging - you don't need to create a waterproof space.

Even though a fridge has more air than a wine cooler, you still need to open the door daily to give the cheeses fresh air. Cheeses "breath" and need oxygen for optimal aging to occur. Part of breathing is exhaling unwanted gases, and with cheeses, this is usually ammonia. 

A musty moldy-smelling cellar is not a good place for young cheeses to grow up.

If air movement is required (in addition to air exchange), a small fan can be placed on one of the shelves. Prevent the fan from blowing directly on any cheeses by providing a baffle of thin cloth or creating an air sock.

### Relative Humidity

The total amount of water vapor in the air - if you could measure its mass - is called `absolute humidity`.

The amount of absolute humidity relative to the maximum amount that same air could hold is called `relative humidity (RH)`.

The vapor occupies empty space between air molecules.

The amount of water vapor carried by the air at any given time is very dependent upon the atmospheric pressure and the temp.

The amount of water vapor needed to saturate the air increases at the temp increases - when all other factors, such as atmospheric pressure are equal. It also decreases as the temp decreases. 

`dew point` is when the `absolute humidity` is the same as the `relative humidity` - meaning that the air is fully saturated with water vapor and condensation begins to occur.

#### Small-Closet Conversion

This is the holy grail for serious hobby cheese makers - their own real cheese cave/cellar/closet. It isn't hard to do.

The first thing to think about is insulation and waterproofing.

Choose a space that naturally mains a steady temp, or one that does not fluctuate in temp too much, and you will be ahead of the game. Best of all is a basement or real cellar.

Provide as much insulation as possible. Waterproof the room so that if it was used as a shower, it would be ok, since the surfaces will need to be wiped and kept clean. 

For commercial-scale information, check out G's book: **The Farmstead Creamery Advisor**.


#### Monitoring Humidity

Many cheesemakers fail to properly monitor humidity.

When cheesemakers talk about and monitor humidity, they are really talking about is `relative humidity (RH)`, but for simplicity's sake, we just call it `humidity`.

Gauges for reading `relative humidity` are called `hygrometers`. 

You can buy simple dial versions, digital varieties, or a wet-dry bulb type also called a `psychrometer`. 

Dial `hygrometers` are usually the cheapest, but don't work well over time. Digital `hygrometers` start at $20 - $30. If you go with digital, make sure you have 2 in the same space, so you can tell if one has a problem if the 2 units have very different readings. They will also allow you to monitor different humidity rates in different parts of your aging space.

G's favorite type of `hygrometer` is a `psychrometer`. 

There is a chart is Appendix C that gives you a table of bulb temps vs RH. Copy the table and keep it handy next to your `psychrometer`.

The goal temp in an aging room, according to G, is 50F - 55F (10C - 13C), so she watches for a 2.5F difference between the bulbs.

The `psychrometer` does not need recalibrating, but needs the wick to be cleaned once in a while and the reservoir of water to be refilled.

She also thinks they look cool.

### Cheeses with Special Needs

All these needs will be discussed in the recipes section as well.

#### High Humidity Needs

Washed rind stinky cheeses and bloomy rinds need extra moisture during aging. Use plastic tubs or a shower-curtain to separate them from other cheeses, and give each space its own `hygrometer`.

#### High Temp Needs

Swiss mountain-type cheese (e.g. Emmental) with large eye formation need a warmer space (60F - 68F [16C - 20C]) for a 2-4 week period. You will need a separate space for this, i.e. its own wine cooler, chest, etc with its own thermostat.

#### Aggressive mold issues

Blue cheeses need to be made and stored completely separately from other cheeses, since their mold is so aggressive, even when another wheel has a rind. Remember, spores can inoculate the milk and bloom later, so total separation is needed.

#### Lower temperature needs

Emmental and blue cheese need a lower temp, so they may need to be stored separately.

### Shelving

Keep in mind the goals of shelving when selecting them: air circulation, the right amount of moisture, and a neutral surface that will not impart any off flavors, toxins, or other undesired elements. 

#### Wood

Wood is the historical ideal cheese-aging shelf for several reasons: 

* it was all that was available for centuries
* it helps maintain humidity without condensation
* it can import its unique stamp of locality - *terroir* (French)

If you are choosing wood, look for thick planks (2 inches is perfect) of tight-grained, pitch-free types of wood. This usually means hardwood without a lot of knots, aka 'clear'. 

More on wood on `p. 83`, if you're interested.

#### Plastic-coated wire shelving

You can set cheeses directly on the plastic-coated wire racks of a refrigerator or on baking racks.

It's a good idea to put down a mat of plastic mesh to help even out the pressure and reduce the chance of creating impressions from the shelving on your cheeses.

#### Cheese closet or cellar

If you have a walk-in aging room (closet or cellar), use freestanding shelving units made of epoxy-coated wire. You can use either mesh mats or wood laid on top of coated shelves. G's favorite is `MetroMax` shelving, which consists of a high-quality epoxy coated framework with snap-on plastic shelving for ease of cleaning.

### Aging-space Cleaning and Housekeeping

Aging rooms are humid and appealing to pests and rodents, and previous cheeses will leave residue behind that can be infected by bad bacteria.

To prevent mildew and molds from growing on the walls of your aging space, wipe down using a chlorine solution or other sanitizer that is adequate (Table 6-1: Guide to Sanitizers and proper dilutions).

If there is evidence of molds or debris, first use a damp cloth or a mild detergent to remove any visible buildup. Make sure not to use excess sanitizer as this could import unfavorable odors and flavors to your aging space, and of course your cheese. 

Remember, by the time you see mildew or mold, it has been there for a while. This is especially true for delicate cheeses such as camembert, which can get infected by mold/mildew.

Some cheeses want a variety of molds, so you have to be careful not to remove the helpful molds, but you must clean more often if you want to keep the surface of the cheese very white.

If the space is tightly sealed, you won't have problems with mice or rats, but you might get flies. Watch out for fly egg cases (they look like black, brown  or white grains of long-grain rice) being laid in nooks and crevices.

In a large space, use fly strips or black light fly traps to help with pest control. 

Cheese mites, though, can get into any place where cheese is being aged with a rind. More on that later.

### Using a cheese trier/iron

A `cheese trier`, or `cheese iron` is a tool for removing a core sample from a whole cheese, and for tapping the outside of a cheese to listen for air pockets.

This tool allows you to check the progress of cheese without cutting into it.

You can help make notes on flavor and texture changes that will greatly help you determine when a cheese is ready.

As cheeses age, they might be bitter. Make notes on bitter phases as they occur and when they end, and this will help you decide on ideal aging lengths for each type of cheese.

A core sample will also help determine when a blue cheese is ready to be wrapped or moved to a colder storage.

Using the iron use to tap a cheese can help determine when eye development is adequate or when a cheese is suffering from early or late blowing (see Affinage Troubleshooting). And it's fun to turn cheese into a percussion instrument.

#### How to core sample a cheese

1. If the cheese is semisoft, pre-chill it to refrigeration temps
2. Sanitize the trier and dry well. You may want to use a warm to hot sanitizing solution to help the trier more easily penetrate the cheese.
3. Insert the trier about 2/3 of its length (if the cheese is large enough) or halfway through the diameter of the cheese.
4. Rotate the trier in several complete rotations
5. Tilt the handle back slightly, and slide the sample out of the cheese.
6. Observer the sample for eyes, flaws, texture and aroma
7. With a  sanitizing knife, cut a small portion from the tip of the sample
8. Slide the trier with the cheese sample on it back into the hole and push from the rind side to seat the sample back into the cheese.
9. Use a tiny bit of the cut sample to smear over the seams
10. Return the cheese to aging, and note on the make sheet the date and results of the sampling.
11. Analyze the sample for texture and flavor.

## Finishing a Cheese

The right choice for rind care is a matter of your individual goals.

#### Vacuum Sealing, Clear Coating, and Waxing

Cheeses aged with a  coating that prevents air from contacting the surface of the cheese are considered "rindless". 

You should consider sealing your cheese with wax or by vacuum sealing if you cannot guarantee that the humidity in the aging environment will be ideal through the cheese's affinage.

Some cheese snobs frown on sealing, but they are stupidheads, as this technique still makes great cheese.

Cheese wax is made of a `paraffin` base (a by-product of petroleum production) with other additives to prevent cracking. Some cheesemakers use beeswax as a substitute. Beeswax works, but is more expensive and softer than cheese wax, and it imparts a lovely honey flavor to the cheese. 

Vacuum sealing, while less traditional and less visually appealing, can be done as an alternative to waxing, which van be messy and painstaking.

Vacuum sealers come in two varieties: smaller household units that will only handle smaller bags and pull the air form them, and large "chambered" units that create a vacuum within the chamber that seals the product between two layers of plastic.

This larger units (Cryovac is the most well-known brand name) are much more effective and versatile, but of course more expensive. They are also excellent for packaging for sale later on.

`Clear coating`, aka `cream wax` or `plastic coating` (brand name Paracoat) is another option and creates a more natural-rind look.

`Clear coating` is a plastic polymer product that smells like glue, and is semipermeable, meaning the cheese will be able to breathe a little bit.

Firstly it inhibits mold (if it has a mold inhibitor), and secondly serves as a primer that will help create a surface to which the wax will better adhere. Many commercial cheesemakers use the clear coat as the primary treatment of their rinds.

Not all clear coats come with a mold inhibitor, and some come with coloring, so choose wisely.

The scientific name of the mold inhibitor is `natamycin` (brand name Natamax, aka pimaricin). It is an anti fungal (or antimycotic) that is non-harmful to humans (only harmful to yeasts and molds) and is authorized for use in organic certified products.
