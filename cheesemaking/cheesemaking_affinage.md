# Affinage

`affinage` is a French word the means ***the art of making cheese***.

A person who specializes in `affinage` is called an `affineur`.

### The Home Cheese Cellar

#### Using a Wine Cooler

G started with a wine cooler for very small amounts of cheese. Then she upgraded to a modified refrigerator.

Wine coolers are excellent for aging cheese - they keep the temperature at 50F - 57f (10C - 14C), which is perfect for cheese. Unlike most fridges, they don't have fans, so they also tend to keep more moisture in the air, which is also perfect for cheese.

Get a wine cooler that stores 20 - 50 bottles. You can take the wine shelves out of the wine cooler and replace them with bakers racks.

While temp is maintained automatically by the wine cooler, you'll have to monitor and maintain `humidity`.  

A simple and effective way to maintain humidity is to hang a moistened terry cloth towel over the lowest shelf in the unit or on the shelves in the door, monitor the humidity, and remoisten as necessary. 

Open the door daily to provide some fresh air for your living breathing cheeses. You can do this at the same time as checking the humidity and turning the cheeses).

> **If any ammonia odors or mustiness develops, you know that your cheeses are not getting enough fresh air!**


#### Using a Refrigerator

Get a fridge that doesn't have a freezer compartment. They are more energy efficient (no freezer to maintain) and they usually don't have fans that would otherwise dry out the cheese.

Make sure to get one with coated wire shelves, not glass shelves!

Glass shelves do not allow adequate air circulation around your cheeses and will accumulate condensation on the undersides of the cheeses that could drip below. 

For about $60 you can buy a special thermostat (designed for beer brewers wanting to convert a fridge or freezer to a fermentation unit).

To operate it, you plug the fridge into the thermostat, plug the thermostat into the outlet, set the dial to the desired temp, and then insert the temp probe into the appliance (usually through the door, which can usually be closed without a problem). 

The thermostat then turns the appliance on and off as needed to maintain the temp. 

**This causes no harm to the appliance**

As with the wine cooler, you can simply increase humidity by hanging a moistened towel or sheeting on a lower shelf so that it doesn't drip on cheeses. 

*Freezers are never good unit to use for cheese aging.*

#### Using a humidified or a small fan

With wine coolers or fridges, if hanging a towel doesn't maintain humidity well enough, you can use a small electric ultrasonic humidifier. Be sure to watch for moisture buildup on the walls and any dripping. 

Even though a fridge has more air than a wine cooler, you still need to open the door daily to give the cheeses fresh air. 

If air movement is required (in addition to air exchange), a small fan can be placed on one of the shelves. Prevent the fan from blowing directly on any cheeses by providing a baffle of thin cloth or creating an air sock.
