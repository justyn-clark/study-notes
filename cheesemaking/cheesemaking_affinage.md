# Affinage

`affinage` is a French word the means ***the art of making cheese***.

A person who specializes in `affinage` is called an `affineur`.

## The Home Cheese Cellar

#### Using a Wine Cooler

G started with a wine cooler for very small amounts of cheese. Then she upgraded to a modified refrigerator.

Wine coolers are excellent for aging cheese - they keep the temperature at 50F - 57f (10C - 14C), which is perfect for cheese. Unlike most fridges, they don't have fans, so they also tend to keep more moisture in the air, which is also perfect for cheese.

Get a wine cooler that stores 20 - 50 bottles. You can take the wine shelves out of the wine cooler and replace them with bakers racks.

While temp is maintained automatically by the wine cooler, you'll have to monitor and maintain `humidity`.  

A simple and effective way to maintain humidity is to hang a moistened terry cloth towel over the lowest shelf in the unit or on the shelves in the door, monitor the humidity, and remoisten as necessary. 

Open the door daily to provide some fresh air for your living breathing cheeses. You can do this at the same time as checking the humidity and turning the cheeses).

> **If any ammonia odors or mustiness develops, you know that your cheeses are not getting enough fresh air!**


#### Using a Refrigerator

Get a fridge that doesn't have a freezer compartment. They are more energy efficient (no freezer to maintain) and they usually don't have fans that would otherwise dry out the cheese.

Make sure to get one with coated wire shelves, not glass shelves!

Glass shelves do not allow adequate air circulation around your cheeses and will accumulate condensation on the undersides of the cheeses that could drip below. 

For about $60 you can buy a special thermostat (designed for beer brewers wanting to convert a fridge or freezer to a fermentation unit).

To operate it, you plug the fridge into the thermostat, plug the thermostat into the outlet, set the dial to the desired temp, and then insert the temp probe into the appliance (usually through the door, which can usually be closed without a problem). 

The thermostat then turns the appliance on and off as needed to maintain the temp. 

**This causes no harm to the appliance**

As with the wine cooler, you can simply increase humidity by hanging a moistened towel or sheeting on a lower shelf so that it doesn't drip on cheeses. 

*Freezers are never good unit to use for cheese aging.*

#### Using a humidified or a small fan

With wine coolers or fridges, if hanging a towel doesn't maintain humidity well enough, you can use a small electric ultrasonic humidifier. Be sure to watch for moisture buildup on the walls and any dripping. 

If you are waxing or otherwise coating your cheeses (or vacuum sealing them), humidity is not important for their proper aging - you don't need to create a waterproof space.

Even though a fridge has more air than a wine cooler, you still need to open the door daily to give the cheeses fresh air. Cheeses "breath" and need oxygen for optimal aging to occur. Part of breathing is exhaling unwanted gases, and with cheeses, this is usually ammonia. 

A musty moldy-smelling cellar is not a good place for young cheeses to grow up.

If air movement is required (in addition to air exchange), a small fan can be placed on one of the shelves. Prevent the fan from blowing directly on any cheeses by providing a baffle of thin cloth or creating an air sock.

### Relative Humidity

The total amount of water vapor in the air - if you could measure its mass - is called `absolute humidity`.

The amount of absolute humidity relative to the maximum amount that same air could hold is called `relative humidity (RH)`.

The vapor occupies empty space between air molecules.

The amount of water vapor carried by the air at any given time is very dependent upon the atmospheric pressure and the temp.

The amount of water vapor needed to saturate the air increases at the temp increases - when all other factors, such as atmospheric pressure are equal. It also decreases as the temp decreases. 

`dew point` is when the `absolute humidity` is the same as the `relative humidity` - meaning that the air is fully saturated with water vapor and condensation begins to occur.

#### Small-Closet Conversion

This is the holy grail for serious hobby cheese makers - their own real cheese cave/cellar/closet. It isn't hard to do.

The first thing to think about is insulation and waterproofing.

Choose a space that naturally mains a steady temp, or one that does not fluctuate in temp too much, and you will be ahead of the game. Best of all is a basement or real cellar.

Provide as much insulation as possible. Waterproof the room so that if it was used as a shower, it would be ok, since the surfaces will need to be wiped and kept clean. 

For commercial-scale information, check out G's book: **The Farmstead Creamery Advisor**.


#### Monitoring Humidity

Many cheesemakers fail to properly monitor humidity.

When cheesemakers talk about and monitor humidity, they are really talking about is `relative humidity (RH)`, but for simplicity's sake, we just call it `humidity`.

Gauges for reading `relative humidity` are called `hygrometers`. 

You can buy simple dial versions, digital varieties, or a wet-dry bulb type also called a `psychrometer`. 

Dial `hygrometers` are usually the cheapest, but don't work well over time. Digital `hygrometers` start at $20 - $30. If you go with digital, make sure you have 2 in the same space, so you can tell if one has a problem if the 2 units have very different readings. They will also allow you to monitor different humidity rates in different parts of your aging space.

G's favorite type of `hygrometer` is a `psychrometer`. 

There is a chart is Appendix C that gives you a table of bulb temps vs RH. Copy the table and keep it handy next to your `psychrometer`.

The goal temp in an aging room, according to G, is 50F - 55F (10C - 13C), so she watches for a 2.5F difference between the bulbs.

The `psychrometer` does not need recalibrating, but needs the wick to be cleaned once in a while and the reservoir of water to be refilled.

She also thinks they look cool.

### Cheeses with Special Needs

All these needs will be discussed in the recipes section as well.

#### High Humidity Needs

Washed rind stinky cheeses and bloomy rinds need extra moisture during aging. Use plastic tubs or a shower-curtain to separate them from other cheeses, and give each space its own `hygrometer`.

#### High Temp Needs

Swiss mountain-type cheese (e.g. Emmental) with large eye formation need a warmer space (60F - 68F [16C - 20C]) for a 2-4 week period. You will need a separate space for this, i.e. its own wine cooler, chest, etc with its own thermostat.

#### Aggressive mold issues

Blue cheeses need to be made and stored completely separately from other cheeses, since their mold is so aggressive, even when another wheel has a rind. Remember, spores can inoculate the milk and bloom later, so total separation is needed.

#### Lower temperature needs

Emmental and blue cheese need a lower temp, so they may need to be stored separately.

### Shelving

Keep in mind the goals of shelving when selecting them: air circulation, the right amount of moisture, and a neutral surface that will not impart any off flavors, toxins, or other undesired elements. 

#### Wood

Wood is the historical ideal cheese-aging shelf for several reasons: 

* it was all that was available for centuries
* it helps maintain humidity without condensation
* it can import its unique stamp of locality - *terroir* (French)

If you are choosing wood, look for thick planks (2 inches is perfect) of tight-grained, pitch-free types of wood. This usually means hardwood without a lot of knots, aka 'clear'. 

More on wood on `p. 83`, if you're interested.

#### Plastic-coated wire shelving

You can set cheeses directly on the plastic-coated wire racks of a refrigerator or on baking racks.

It's a good idea to put down a mat of plastic mesh to help even out the pressure and reduce the chance of creating impressions from the shelving on your cheeses.

#### Cheese closet or cellar

If you have a walk-in aging room (closet or cellar), use freestanding shelving units made of epoxy-coated wire. You can use either mesh mats or wood laid on top of coated shelves. G's favorite is `MetroMax` shelving, which consists of a high-quality epoxy coated framework with snap-on plastic shelving for ease of cleaning.

### Aging-space Cleaning and Housekeeping

Aging rooms are humid and appealing to pests and rodents, and previous cheeses will leave residue behind that can be infected by bad bacteria.

To prevent mildew and molds from growing on the walls of your aging space, wipe down using a chlorine solution or other sanitizer that is adequate (Table 6-1: Guide to Sanitizers and proper dilutions).

If there is evidence of molds or debris, first use a damp cloth or a mild detergent to remove any visible buildup. Make sure not to use excess sanitizer as this could import unfavorable odors and flavors to your aging space, and of course your cheese. 

Remember, by the time you see mildew or mold, it has been there for a while. This is especially true for delicate cheeses such as camembert, which can get infected by mold/mildew.

Some cheeses want a variety of molds, so you have to be careful not to remove the helpful molds, but you must clean more often if you want to keep the surface of the cheese very white.

If the space is tightly sealed, you won't have problems with mice or rats, but you might get flies. Watch out for fly egg cases (they look like black, brown  or white grains of long-grain rice) being laid in nooks and crevices.

In a large space, use fly strips or black light fly traps to help with pest control. 

Cheese mites, though, can get into any place where cheese is being aged with a rind. More on that later.

### Using a cheese trier/iron

A `cheese trier`, or `cheese iron` is a tool for removing a core sample from a whole cheese, and for tapping the outside of a cheese to listen for air pockets.

This tool allows you to check the progress of cheese without cutting into it.

You can help make notes on flavor and texture changes that will greatly help you determine when a cheese is ready.

As cheeses age, they might be bitter. Make notes on bitter phases as they occur and when they end, and this will help you decide on ideal aging lengths for each type of cheese.

A core sample will also help determine when a blue cheese is ready to be wrapped or moved to a colder storage.

Using the iron use to tap a cheese can help determine when eye development is adequate or when a cheese is suffering from early or late blowing (see Affinage Troubleshooting). And it's fun to turn cheese into a percussion instrument.

#### How to core sample a cheese

1. If the cheese is semisoft, pre-chill it to refrigeration temps
2. Sanitize the trier and dry well. You may want to use a warm to hot sanitizing solution to help the trier more easily penetrate the cheese.
3. Insert the trier about 2/3 of its length (if the cheese is large enough) or halfway through the diameter of the cheese.
4. Rotate the trier in several complete rotations
5. Tilt the handle back slightly, and slide the sample out of the cheese.
6. Observer the sample for eyes, flaws, texture and aroma
7. With a  sanitizing knife, cut a small portion from the tip of the sample
8. Slide the trier with the cheese sample on it back into the hole and push from the rind side to seat the sample back into the cheese.
9. Use a tiny bit of the cut sample to smear over the seams
10. Return the cheese to aging, and note on the make sheet the date and results of the sampling.
11. Analyze the sample for texture and flavor.

## Finishing a Cheese

The right choice for rind care is a matter of your individual goals. Unwaxed cheese rinds are completely edible, but not always so tasty. Some people consider them a delicacy, animals love them, and they can be used to flavor soup.

#### Vacuum Sealing, Clear Coating, and Waxing

Cheeses aged with a  coating that prevents air from contacting the surface of the cheese are considered "rindless". 

You should consider sealing your cheese with wax or by vacuum sealing if you cannot guarantee that the humidity in the aging environment will be ideal through the cheese's affinage.

Some cheese snobs frown on sealing, but they are stupidheads, as this technique still makes great cheese.

Cheese wax is made of a `paraffin` base (a by-product of petroleum production) with other additives to prevent cracking. Some cheesemakers use beeswax as a substitute. Beeswax works, but is more expensive and softer than cheese wax, and it imparts a lovely honey flavor to the cheese. 

Vacuum sealing, while less traditional and less visually appealing, can be done as an alternative to waxing, which van be messy and painstaking.

Vacuum sealers come in two varieties: smaller household units that will only handle smaller bags and pull the air form them, and large "chambered" units that create a vacuum within the chamber that seals the product between two layers of plastic.

This larger units (Cryovac is the most well-known brand name) are much more effective and versatile, but of course more expensive. They are also excellent for packaging for sale later on.

`Clear coating`, aka `cream wax` or `plastic coating` (brand name Paracoat) is another option and creates a more natural-rind look.

`Clear coating` is a plastic polymer product that smells like glue, and is semipermeable, meaning the cheese will be able to breathe a little bit.

Firstly it inhibits mold (if it has a mold inhibitor), and secondly serves as a primer that will help create a surface to which the wax will better adhere. Many commercial cheesemakers use the clear coat as the primary treatment of their rinds.

Not all clear coats come with a mold inhibitor, and some come with coloring, so choose wisely.

The scientific name of the mold inhibitor is `natamycin` (brand name Natamax, aka pimaricin). It is an anti fungal (or antimycotic) that is non-harmful to humans (only harmful to yeasts and molds) and is authorized for use in organic certified products.

#### When to wax, Coat, or Seal

`Timing` is the most important issue with coating cheeses.

If the cheese was not first properly pressed or air-dried, it will weep whey after being sealed, create loose pockets and possibly rot.

The cheese is ready to seal when the surface of the cheese is sufficiently dry, usually after a week to 10 days of aging at 50F - 55F (10C - 13C) at 85% RH. Larger wheels will take a bit longer to dry properly than small wheels. 

Many recipes call for air-drying at room temp, which G doesn't recommend, as bad bacteria can grow at those temps.

During the drying period, be vigilant about mold growth on the surface.

At the first signs of mold, take a cloth moistened in a light brine (solution of 1 tablespoon salt and 1 tablespoon vinegar [optional] to 1 cup of water) and gently rub the surface of the cheese. Be sure not to leave the surface of the cheese wet.

#### How to wax and coat

In general, the hotter the wax, the colder the cheese should be. If the wax is low temp, a cold cheese will thicken the wax very quickly. If the wax is high temp, a chilled cheese will help prevent the hot wax from bringing fat out of the cheese.

A blue cheese should use a medium heat wax (p. 87)

The cheese must also be prepared for waxing. The surface should look firm and smooth and be free from mold. If mold is present, even a faint white bloom, follow the procedure above. 

For cooler wax temps, allow the cheese to come to room temp before waxing.

If it is a hot day and the room temp is above 70F (21C), wait until the room cools.

For hotter wax applications, clean the cheese as above, then chill thoroughly to refrigeration temps.

If you are clear coating before waxing, the cheese can go back to agin g for another week or two before applying the hard wax. 

Waxing can be done over a large temp range, from low 120F (49C) to the more dangerous high temp of 220F (104C). The high temp method can scald the skin easily and is a fire risk, but it will kill mold spores on the surface of the cheese. 

You can use a double boiler to melt wax or a recyclable aluminum foil tray and set on a very low direct heat.

The best is a slow cooker, or crock-pot. This eliminates open flames, hot birders or the possibility of water splashing in.

Once you are done, you can turn the unit off and let the wax harden inside.

#### Steps for waxing a cheese

1. Prepare the cheese as mentioned above
2. Dip half of the cheese into the hot wax
3. Hold wheel above wax, and juggle gently to remove excess wax
4. Place wheel above wax, unwaxed side down, on a mat or board
5. When wax is dry, dip second side as before. Make sure that the 2 coats touch evenly around the cheese
6. Allow to dry
7. Repeat steps 2 through 6 - make sure the 1st wax seam is at 90 deg to the second.
8. If you have any pinholes, drop wax onto them to seal them up

Use a wax thermometer to check wax temp.

A curved drying rack can be very helpful for success in waxing.

Some people prefer to brush the wax on, as it is simpler, but this leaves brush-strokes in the wax. Use a natural brush, not a synthetic. Also there are contraptions to whole dip the cheese in wax.

#### Precautions to take with waxing

1. Be sure to work in a well-ventilated area. Wax fumes are not healthy and can ignite
2. Wear protective clothing that will not stick to you if hot wax spills on it.
3. Wear goggles when working with temps over 120F (t49C)
4. Wear gloves

#### Bandaged rinds

Bandaging, an old technique, is seeing a resurgence in recent years.

The resulting cheese is called `clothbound` or `bandaged`. 

You can bandage any semi hard to hard cheese, but typically cheeses aging less than 6 months won't need the extra protection of a bandage wrap. Extra-hard (grana) cheeses are never bandaged, but you have a different goal: the driest of textures.

The bandage and lard (or butter) wrap is embedded in the cheese's surface during an extra step of pressing. During aging the wrapping is gently brushed to limit mold growth but is never scrubbed or washed with brine. During very long aging, bandage wrapped cheeses are very susceptible to cheese-mite damage.

Usually, the bandage wrapping is removed prior to cutting, unless it is desired for aesthetic reasons.

More on bandaging on `p. 89`.

#### Brushed rinds

One of the simplest ways to create a beautiful natural rind is to brush the rind periodically during aging. As with a bandaged rind, brushing does not eliminate the molds but instead limits their growth and "damage" to the rind.

In the beginning, use a very soft brush to prevent damaging the still soft cheese. It is a good idea to have a minimum of two textures of brushes, one soft and one medium, to maintain brushed rinds.

There are no hard and fast guidelines for when to brush a cheese. G tries to brush them before it is obvious they need it. If the first brush swipes release a cloud of mold spores into the air, you probably waited too long.

When brushing, take your clean, sanitized, bone-dry brush and gently which it across the surface of the cheese. Doing this over a sink or moist surface can help trap much of the mold spores and stop them being airborne.

Continue to brush until the rind looks smooth. Never use a scrubbing or circular motion, but rather brush the mold off the cheese. 

The goal is to prevent the molds from growing so rampantly that they form a thick rind and attract cheese mites.

Once done, the brush should be thoroughly washed, sanitized, and placed in a clean area to dry. You should have 2 pairs, just in case one is still drying. Never use these brushes on anything besides cheese.

#### Oiled rinds

Oiling is another old technique. Grana-type cheeses, such as Parmigiano Reggiano, have an oiled rind that darkens somewhat and creates a lovely patina by the end of aging.

The oil discourages most molds, as does the act of rubbing the oil onto the cheese. Cheese mites are also impeded by the oil simply because it is hard for their legs to move on the sticky surface.

You can use any food-quality oil on an aging cheese, but olive oil and olive oil blends are favorites. (Maybe use almond oil?)

When the cheese rind has dried off, usually 1-2 weeks into aging, you can apply the first coat of oil. If molds are present, brush or wipe them off first with a soft dry brush or dry cloth.

New coats can be applied as needed when the cheese appears to be drying, when molds are present, or even if you simply feel like it. There are no set rules. After a few coats, you won't need to apply more oil as often and the rind should start developing some depth of color.

Oiling can be combined with the application of other herbs, species or ingredients such as ash or cocoa. 

#### Washed rinds

`washed rinds` can really be divided into 2 categories of cheese: 

* those that develop a sticky, reddish, smelly rind from the activity of surface bacteria 
* those that are wiped or washed with other liquids to create a unique but firm and ultimately dry rind. 

The red stinky variety is sometimes called `washed rind` cheese, which can cause some confusion.

### Affinage Troubleshooting

#### Problems with Waxed and Sealed Cheeses

When you wax a cheese, everything is trapped under the wax, including mold spores and gas-producing bacteria.

If mold grows under the wax and is minimal, you don't need to do anything. If mold growth is extensive, remove the wax, clean and dry the cheese and reapply the wax. A pre-coat of liquid clear coat with mold inhibitor might be helpful if the problem keeps reoccurring. 

Be sure to alway clean the surface of the cheese before waxing with a vinegar solution.

Make sure that the curd is sufficiently dry before waxing, otherwise the whey will be trapped under the wax, leading to blistering or a moist surface.

Be careful when using gas-producing bacteria, as this can fill the cheese and the wax. 

#### Cheese Mites

For some cheesemakers, mites are a normal, expected and sometimes even desired part of the aging process, while for others, they are persona non grata.

You know you have cheese mites in your aging room if you start seeing a dry, fine powder on the floor or surface of the cheeses. This `cheese dust` is composed of living and dead mites, bits of cheese, cheese rind, and mite excrement.

If you start seeing plugs of loose rind and craters on the surface of your cheese, you know that you have a large, very successfully population of cheese mites.

Cheese mites dig in an tunnel through the rind of unwaxed and otherwise unprotected aging cheeses, including bandage-wrapped cheddars.

It is believed they may not be after the cheeses, but instead are eating the fungi (molds) on the cheeses, digging under the surface for the parts of the fungus that grow there. 

It is even thought that the fungi and the mites have a symbiotic relationship - by eroding the surface, the mites help the molds find more area to grow.

Generally, they only start work on cheese that is a couple of months old. 

Cheeses that are being brine washed, rubbed with oil, or regularly brushed usually don't see evidence of mites until much later in their aging. 

If rind treatment continues throughout aging, their activity is limited through the controlling of mold growth, as well as inhospitable surface that such treatments create for the mites.

Early intervention is the key factor in getting them out of your aging room.

Once the mites burrow under the surface of the cheese, it is almost impossible to get them out. They are protected.

Brushing and vacuuming are mechanical means of limiting mites. If you are brushing, remove the cheeses from the aging room and brush them onto a damp floor or into a sink, so the dust sticks to the moist surface.

Vacuuming can be done with a small vacuum that you keep just for this purpose. 

Both brushing and vacuuming will need to be done very regularly to have much effect. 

Mites seem to prefer a flat surface and darkness, so you will see more activity on the underside of the wheel that is aged on flat surfaces, vs the curved sides. Wheels that are aged on their curved sides seem to suffer a bit less damage. 

Wood keeps mites dark and protected, and they can't fall off the wheel as easily.

Chilling and freezing don't seem to have any effect on them.

Waxing, clear coating and vacuum sealing will of course prevent infestation, but bandaging will not.

Bandage-wrapped cheddars seem to have the biggest problem here.

Fumigation of the aging room is no longer acceptable or allowed.

jMany cheesemakers find the best remedy is to use food-grade `diatomaceous earth (DE)`. When dusted using a fine meshed sieve on the surface of the cheese, the `DE` dehydrates the mites, but this technique must be used early in the process, before the mites have burrowed underneath the surface.

Use a mask when using `DE`. While not toxic, the powder is not good for your lungs.

`Hydrogen Peroxide` can be used when mixed to a 10% wash, following vacuuming or before infestation occurs. This does not sound appetizing if your rinds are typically consumed by customers.

Larger facilities are using ozone machines. Ozone (`o3`) attacks organic compounds, such as mold, yeast, phage and bacteria. Mites don't like the ozone, as it can kill them. 

Since mold growth is also limited by ozone, the cheese surface becomes less appealing. 

G uses an ozone machine for mildew prevention, air freshening and general sanitation in the cheese make room.

G' says it rid her aging room of mites. 

#### Blowing 

The term `blowing` refers to a cheese's developing gas in a manner that causes the cheese to swell or blow. (`p.96`)

You can have `early` or `late` blowing, and they're both easy to correlate with the symptoms.

##### Early Blowing

`Early blowing` is most often caused by the presence of `coliform bacteria` or yeasts in the cheese milk. 

In a soft, lactic acid-set cheese, the blowing manifests as a frothy, gassy curd.

In a pressed or drained cheese, early blowing is seen as uncountable numbers of tiny round holes in the cheese or yeast eyes that are two to three times larger than the tiny eyes that appear within a day or so after pressing.

You may only discover these at cutting.

`Coliform eyes` are tiny and elliptical and will be shiny.  

The most common cause of this type of contamination is **poor milk collection** and **poor production cleanliness**.

Slow chilling of milk and poor acid development in the vat are also likely causes.

Cheese with this defect should be **thrown out**. 

##### Late Blowing

`Late blowing` is most often caused by one or more bacteria from the `Clostridiaceae` family. Tetnus and botulism are also part of this family. `Clostridia` blowing creates a very easy-to-identify look in mature cheese. Besides swelling and doming, the cut cheese will reveal a spongelike look often accompanied by cracks and fissures.

Cheese with this defect should also be **thrown out**. 

There are 3 main subspecies of `clostridia` that cause `blowing`, each at different stages: 

* one early in ripening (but later than `coliform` blowing) - `C. butyricum`
* one at about a year - `C. tyrobutyricum`
* and one after a year - `C. sporongenes`

The prevention of each is the same. The feeding of poor-quality silage (fermented forages such as hay, corn, soybeans, and other feeds) to animals is linked to the presence of `clostridia` as these spore formers grow well when silage does not ferment properly. 

For this reason, the feeding of silage is forbidden for the production of `Parmigiano Reggiano` and several other `Protected Designation of Origin (PDO)` cheeses.

Teat sanitation at milking has recently been stuied as another prime time for preventing `clostridia` from contaminating the milk. 

Cheeses whose curd is salted prior to pressing (e.g. cheddar) are less at risk for developing closing from `clostridium`.

At the industrial scale, `nitrate` or `lysozym` can be added to inhibit growth of spore-forming bacteria.

Another `late-blowing` bacteria can be `propionic acid bacteria (PAB)`. `PAB` is purposely added to Emmental to form eyes, but in other cheeses it is a problem.

For home cheese making, prevention is usually a matter of pasteurizing (or for raw milk production the prevention of cross-contamination of `PAB` cultures with other cultures, equipment and milk).

Another primary prevention method is maintaining temps at which `PAB` will not growL 55F (13C) and under.

#### Cracks and Crevices

Cracks in cheese can be on the surface of the rind, run throughout the cheese, or located only within the paste. 

Superficial cracks in a pressed cheese are most often caused by low humidity in the aging room. If these develop early, it doesn't mean the entire cheese will be lost, but can mean a significant portion will have intrusion of mold.

How much of the wheel is lost depends on how many mechanical eyes (openings) are in the cheese.

If there are many, the mold and other contaminants will likely work their way through the entire wheel. 

Don't confuse a crease from a cheesecloth with a try crack. Creases may become filled with molds but will remain superficial in nature.

Cracks in non-pressed cheeses, such as mold-ripened varieties, can occur in places where curd does not knit properly during draining, or form a late-draining pocket of whey.

To prevent these, make sure curd size, or layers, is even in the form and that temp during draining is optimal.

You can briefly pierce the center of draining cheeses with a knife to help assis draining of any trapped whey.

Crevices that run throughout a wheel usually occur when large hunks of curd are put tighter in a  form and do not knit properly. This can be from too-low temp at darning, too much initial pressure, or pressure that is too low during the last stages of pressing.

#### Holes and Soft Spots

Rinds can have a variety of issues with soft spots and holes. Brine or slating issues are common causes for softening ad so-called `rind rot` problems later in aging.

If the salt content of the brine is inadequate or dry saluting is not thorough and even, that portion of the rind is susceptible to early invasion by molds and other organisms that will erode the rind. 

The rind is also vulnerable to moisture from condensation, touching another cheese, or inadequate air circulation. Even some spilled salt on a rind will cause moisture to be drawn to the salt and cause a `soft spot`.

#### Uninvited Fungi and Bacteria

There is almost no limit to the number of fungi (mods and yeasts) and airborne or moisture borne bacteria that can inhabit an aging room. Fortunately, most are aesthetic issues, not food safety concerns. Here are several...

##### Mildew

A flat (non-fuzzy) black fungus, mildew is usually only a problem when the humidity in the environment is too high and the air exchange and movement too low. When this appears, check these above causes and use a light brine or vinegar moistened cloth to help kill the mold. The cheese will remain stained, but the mold should cease to grow.

##### Furry Black/Brown Mold

Furry black or brown mold (`mucor`) is probably one of the most common `problem` molds for cheeses. It is part of the `Mucoraceae` family and is also known as `poil de chat` (cat's fur). `Mucor` isn't a big problem for rinded aged cheeses, and can be controlled with brushing or brine wiping. It's a much bigger problem on white surface-ripened cheeses. 

Make sure the cheese have dried sufficiently and that the conditions are correct.

If you see a haze of tan, use a gloved sanitized hand to press it down before mold spores are spread. 

Use a chlorine-dampened cloth (50 - 100 parts per million) and lightly touch the mold. Instead of chlorine, you can try using hydrogen peroxide at 3%-8%.

Either way, you can rescue the cheese.

##### White Flaking / Tan Pitting

Initially you will see a white flaky growth and later a beige/tan growth that leaves craters and pits. The most likely culprit is `Scopulariopis brevicaulis`. At an early stage, it can be vigorously brushed and limited. Once it begins pitting, you cannot remove it. It isn't harmful, but you will lose quite a bit of rind. Mites will take advantage of this.

##### Fuzzy Blue Mold

Bloe molds are very aggressive. They need oxygen, so aren't usually a problem inside cheeses with well-closed rinds and a tight paste. Surface growing blues can be limited early by brushing or washing. In general, blues like a certain amount of salt and are find with vinegar, so brushing or wiping might work better than vinegar or brine washing.

##### Red, Oragne, Pink, and White Smooth to Slimy

Any number of surface bacteria can change the color, texture and aroma of a cheese. These are usually in the `corneyform bacteria`.

##### Miscellaneous and Unusual

Cheeses that are allowed to develop surface molds can show splotches of yellow, scarlet and purple. None of these colors is any indicator of `bad` molds or contamination, but if your cheese glows in the dark, or in the presence of a black light, `Pseudomnas fluorescns` is the culprit. It is a cold-loving bacteria that contaminates milk and can live in brine. 

They usually only appear on the outside of cheeses, and are a bigger problem for soft cheese. Good sanitation, rapid chilling of milk and good brine maintenance are usually the best preventative measure.

##### Botulism Concerns

Botulism is sometimes fatal and is caused by the bacterium `Clostridium botulinum`. Botulism is rarely a concern in cheese production and consumption, but becomes a concern whenever plant matter is added.

Fortunately, cheese is usually quite inhospitable environment for `C. Botulinum`. The acid, salt level, moisture level and storage temp all help prevent spores from germinating.

The higher the moisture of the cheese, the greater the risk that spores will germinate.

When adding herbs and spices, keep `C. botunlinum` in mind. This especially comes into play when marinating cheeses in oil or other anaerobic solutions as botulinum spores germinate only in an oxygen-free environment.

For this reasons, such combinations should usually be stored at refrigeration temps - 38F (3C).
