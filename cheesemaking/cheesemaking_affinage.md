### The Home Cheese Cellar

G started with a wine cooler for very small amounts of cheese. Then she upgraded to a modified refrigerator.

Wine coolers are excellent for aging cheese - they keep the temperature at 50F - 57f (10C - 14C), which is perfect for cheese. Unlike most fridges, they don't have fans, so they also tend to keep more moisture in the air, which is also perfect for cheese.
