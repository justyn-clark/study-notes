# Affinage

`affinage` is a French word the means ***the art of making cheese***.

A person who specializes in `affinage` is called an `affineur`.

### The Home Cheese Cellar

#### Using a Wine Cooler

G started with a wine cooler for very small amounts of cheese. Then she upgraded to a modified refrigerator.

Wine coolers are excellent for aging cheese - they keep the temperature at 50F - 57f (10C - 14C), which is perfect for cheese. Unlike most fridges, they don't have fans, so they also tend to keep more moisture in the air, which is also perfect for cheese.

Get a wine cooler that stores 20 - 50 bottles. You can take the wine shelves out of the wine cooler and replace them with bakers racks.

While temp is maintained automatically by the wine cooler, you'll have to monitor and maintain `humidity`.  

A simple and effective way to maintain humidity is to hang a moistened terry cloth towel over the lowest shelf in the unit or on the shelves in the door, monitor the humidity, and remoisten as necessary. 

Open the door daily to provide some fresh air for your living breathing cheeses. You can do this at the same time as checking the humidity and turning the cheeses).

> **If any ammonia odors or mustiness develops, you know that your cheeses are not getting enough fresh air!**


#### Using a Refrigerator

Get a fridge that doesn't have a freezer compartment. They are more energy efficient (no freezer to maintain) and they usually don't have fans that would otherwise dry out the cheese.

Make sure to get one with coated wire shelves, not glass shelves!

Glass shelves do not allow adequate air circulation around your cheeses and will accumulate condensation on the undersides of the cheeses that could drip below. 

For about $60 you can buy a special thermostat (designed for beer brewers wanting to convert a fridge or freezer to a fermentation unit).

To operate it, you plug the fridge into the thermostat, plug the thermostat into the outlet, set the dial to the desired temp, and then insert the temp probe into the appliance (usually through the door, which can usually be closed without a problem). 

The thermostat then turns the appliance on and off as needed to maintain the temp. 

**This causes no harm to the appliance**

As with the wine cooler, you can simply increase humidity by hanging a moistened towel or sheeting on a lower shelf so that it doesn't drip on cheeses. 

*Freezers are never good unit to use for cheese aging.*

#### Using a humidified or a small fan

With wine coolers or fridges, if hanging a towel doesn't maintain humidity well enough, you can use a small electric ultrasonic humidifier. Be sure to watch for moisture buildup on the walls and any dripping. 

If you are waxing or otherwise coating your cheeses (or vacuum sealing them), humidity is not important for their proper aging - you don't need to create a waterproof space.

Even though a fridge has more air than a wine cooler, you still need to open the door daily to give the cheeses fresh air. Cheeses "breath" and need oxygen for optimal aging to occur. Part of breathing is exhaling unwanted gases, and with cheeses, this is usually ammonia. 

A musty moldy-smelling cellar is not a good place for young cheeses to grow up.

If air movement is required (in addition to air exchange), a small fan can be placed on one of the shelves. Prevent the fan from blowing directly on any cheeses by providing a baffle of thin cloth or creating an air sock.

### Relative Humidity

The total amount of water vapor in the air - if you could measure its mass - is called `absolute humidity`.

The amount of absolute humidity relative to the maximum amount that same air could hold is called `relative humidity (RH)`.

The vapor occupies empty space between air molecules.

The amount of water vapor carried by the air at any given time is very dependent upon the atmospheric pressure and the temp.

The amount of water vapor needed to saturate the air increases at the temp increases - when all other factors, such as atmospheric pressure are equal. It also decreases as the temp decreases. 

`dew point` is when the `absolute humidity` is the same as the `relative humidity` - meaning that the air is fully saturated with water vapor and condensation begins to occur.

#### Small-Closet Conversion

This is the holy grail for serious hobby cheese makers - their own real cheese cave/cellar/closet. It isn't hard to do.

The first thing to think about is insulation and waterproofing.

Choose a space that naturally mains a steady temp, or one that does not fluctuate in temp too much, and you will be ahead of the game. Best of all is a basement or real cellar.

Provide as much insulation as possible. Waterproof the room so that if it was used as a shower, it would be ok, since the surfaces will need to be wiped and kept clean.

#### Monitoring Humidity

Many cheesemakers fail to properly monitor humidity.

When cheesemakers talk about and monitor humidity, they are really talking about is `relative humidity (RH)`, but for simplicity's sake, we just call it `humidity`.

Gauges for reading `relative humidity` are called `hygrometers`. 

You can buy simple dial versions, digital varieties, or a wet-dry bulb type also called a `psychrometer`. 

Dial `hygrometers` are usually the cheapest, but don't work well over time. Digital `hygrometers` start at $20 - $30. If you go with digital, make sure you have 2 in the same space, so you can tell if one has a problem if the 2 units have very different readings. They will also allow you to monitor different humidity rates in different parts of your aging space.

G's favorite type of `hygrometer` is a `psychrometer`. 

There is a chart is Appendix C that gives you a table of bulb temps vs RH. Copy the table and keep it handy next to your `psychrometer`.

The goal temp in an aging room, according to G, is 50F - 55F (10C - 13C), so she watches for a 2.5F difference between the bulbs.

The `psychrometer` does not need recalibrating, but needs the wick to be cleaned once in a while and the reservoir of water to be refilled.

She also thinks they look cool.
