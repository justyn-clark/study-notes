# CheeseMaking Tips

##### Must-Own Culture Blends

These three core culture blends are used to make almost every cheese in the G's book.

* **Fresh, feta, and surface-ripened cheeses:** - Flora Danica by Ch. Hansen
* **Semi-hard to hard aged cheeses whose curd is cooked to only 102F (39C):** MA 4000 by Choozit
* **Italian style and any cheese whose curd is cooked over 102F (39C):** Thermo B by Abiasa

This will be a very good start.

Purchase ten-unit package and then repackage them into smaller doses. This will save on costs.


#### Testing milk for coagulation before making cheese

(this is so cool!!)

Here is a test using flocculation which checks if the milk is suitable for cheese making. 

1. Mix 24 milliliters cool water with 1.25 milliliters double-strength rennet.
2. Warm 1/4 cup milk to 92F (33C) in a clear measuring cup
3. Add 10 milliliters of rennet mixture to warm milk wile swirling milk. 
4. Time the seconds it takes for small flocs to form on sides of measuring cup.

If it takes more than 20 seconds to flocculate, there is an issue with the milk. 

Repeat the test, but this time add 1/8 teaspoon calcium chloride to the milk. If flocculation time improves, then add calcium chloride to the cheese milk at the recommended rate.

#### Nice things to do for your rennet/coagulant

1. Keep it in the dark. Light reduces activity.
2. Keep it cool. Store at fridge temp, never freezing
3. Don't dilute with water until just before use
4. Keep it fresh. Old rennet causes bitterness

#### Using Washing The Curds as an Emergency Measure

You can wash the curds as an emergency measure to slow `pH` development or to increase the moisture content and mineral retention of the finished curd in almost any cheese.
