# Cheesemaking Equipment

See appendix B for sources of these items.

#### Cheese Vat

It is best if your receptacle (cheese pan or vat) is made of high quality stainless steel. Low quality stainless steal is easily identifiable by being cheap. Don't get it.

> If the pot is too cheap to be true, its too cheap for you

The surface must be easily cleaned, so no deep scratches, nooks or rivets on the inside.

> The surface must be easily cleaned

The most common at-home cheese vat is a double-boiler. Make sure the inner pot does not sit directly on the bottom pot base by using some steel cooling racks.

For small batches, some cheesemakers are very happy to use slow cookers, aka Crock-Pots.

#### Cheese Hoops

Cheese hoops or molds must be made of food-grade plastic and be easily cleanable. 

Molds intended to be used on pressed cheeses will need to be rugged and able to handle the pressure of a mechanical press.

The plastic forms come in 4 basic types:

* those meant to be used with cheesecloth and pressure
* basket-type form for ladled, unpressed curd
* micro perforated forms with many tiny holes to simulate the effect of cheesecloth
* Kadova-type forms that have a built-in mesh lining

Kadova and micro perforated are designed to be used with a  mechanical press.

Both these types are notoriously difficult to clean, especially the micro perforated types, but they also eliminate the need for cheesecloth and the cleaning involved with its use.

#### Cheesecloth, Draining Bags, Mats

Cheesecloth serves two purposes during draining.

* it helps to keep the loose curd in a shape while it kings back together
* it helps wick whey away tom the cheese toward drainage holes in the form

It is important to choose the right fabric to properly drain the type of cheese 
you are making.

Follow this policy: The finer and softer the curd, the tighter the wave of the cloth should be.

Don't buy from a supermarket, but from a proper cheesemaking supply company.

In general, the finer weave cloth will serve well for all applications.


**Draining bags** are designed for making soft, spreadable cheeses. 

**Draining mats**  can be used directly under cheese such as Brie and Camembert during draining and aging, under forms during draining (to help keep the form itself up and out of the draining whey), and under hard cheese during aging (to promote airflow around the cheese).

#### Room temperature

The usual ideal temp during cheesemaking and draining is 70F - 72F (21C - 22C). Ideally, your cheesemaking space will be climate controlled.

#### Storage for Cultures and Coagulants

Use Freeze-dried direct-set cultures. They are the most convenient and reliable.

These type s of cultures will be best stored in the freezer, and you want to check that it has a manual defroster

Coagulants (rennet) will be stored in the fridge. 

It is totally ok to store rennet next to everything else (ketchup, etc). 

Keep rennet away from light, so wrap the bottle in foil if you need to.

Use a hand-held vacuum sealer to remove air from culture storage containers, otherwise air and moisture might deactivate it.

### Dealing with Rust on Stainless Steel

Scrub the rusty area with steel wool as smoothly as possible, then treat the area with lemon juice, or another form of acid.

### Cleaning Chemicals

Detergents are for cleaning, sanitizers are for sanitizing, and acids are for removing calcium deposits and sanitizing. 

##### Detergents

You will need hot water and physical exertion to do the job. Unscented is best. Use Dawn brand. 

##### Sanitizers

Sanitizers are used to eliminate any bacteria that scrubbing and washing might not have removed. They are meant to follow thorough cleaning 

> You can't sanitize something that isn't clean

Sanitizing can be done with heat or with chemicals.

The most readily available sanitizer to use at home and in small creameries is often `chlorine`. It is available in the form of grocery store bleach. Quite often, too munch is used, leading to residue on equipment that can then lead to personal and equipment harm.

If you're going to use `bleach`, buy some cheap `chlorine` dilution test strips. This ensures the proper amount of sanitizer is being used. Use them regularly.

##### Acid Rinses

Acid, at the right strength, plays two roles in the cheese make room:

* a solvent of mineral deposits
* a residual sanitizer

For the home cheese maker, it only needs to be used periodically to prevent the buildup of what is commonly called `milkstone`.

`Milkstone` build up slowly as the minerals in milk are steadily deposited on surfaces.
