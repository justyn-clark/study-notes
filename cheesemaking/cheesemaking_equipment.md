# Cheesemaking Equipment

See appendix B for sources of these items.

#### Cheese Vat

It is best if your receptacle (cheese pan or vat) is made of high quality stainless steel. Low quality stainless steal is easily identifiable by being cheap. Don't get it.

> If the pot is too cheap to be true, its too cheap for you

The surface must be easily cleaned, so no deep scratches, nooks or rivets on the inside.

> The surface must be easily cleaned

The most common at-home cheese vat is a double-boiler. Make sure the inner pot does not sit directly on the bottom pot base by using some steel cooling racks.

For small batches, some cheesemakers are very happy to use slow cookers, aka Crock-Pots.

#### Cheese Hoops

Cheese hoops or molds must be made of food-grade plastic and be easily cleanable. 

Molds intended to be used on pressed cheeses will need to be rugged and able to handle the pressure of a mechanical press.

The plastic forms come in 4 basic types:

* those meant to be used with cheesecloth and pressure
* basket-type form for ladled, unpressed curd
* micro perforated forms with many tiny holes to simulate the effect of cheesecloth
* Kadova-type forms that have a built-in mesh lining

Kadova and micro perforated are designed to be used with a  mechanical press.

Both these types are notoriously difficult to clean, especially the micro perforated types, but they also eliminate the need for cheesecloth and the cleaning involved with its use.

#### Cheesecloth, Draining Bags, Mats

Cheesecloth serves two purposes during draining.

* it helps to keep the loose curd in a shape while it kings back together
* it helps wick whey away tom the cheese toward drainage holes in the form

It is important to choose the right fabric to properly drain the type of cheese 
you are making.

Follow this policy: The finer and softer the curd, the tighter the wave of the cloth should be.

Don't buy from a supermarket, but from a proper cheesemaking supply company.

In general, the finer weave cloth will serve well for all applications.


**Draining bags** are designed for making soft, spreadable cheeses. 

**Draining mats**  can be used directly under cheese such as Brie and Camembert during draining and aging, under forms during draining (to help keep the form itself up and out of the draining whey), and under hard cheese during aging (to promote airflow around the cheese).

#### Room temperature

The usual ideal temp during cheesemaking and draining is 70F - 72F (21C - 22C). Ideally, your cheesemaking space will be climate controlled.

#### Storage for Cultures and Coagulants

Use Freeze-dried direct-set cultures. They are the most convenient and reliable.

These type s of cultures will be best stored in the freezer, and you want to check that it has a manual defroster

Coagulants (rennet) will be stored in the fridge. 

It is totally ok to store rennet next to everything else (ketchup, etc). 

Keep rennet away from light, so wrap the bottle in foil if you need to.

Use a hand-held vacuum sealer to remove air from culture storage containers, otherwise air and moisture might deactivate it.

### Dealing with Rust on Stainless Steel

Scrub the rusty area with steel wool as smoothly as possible, then treat the area with lemon juice, or another form of acid.

### Cleaning Chemicals

Detergents are for cleaning, sanitizers are for sanitizing, and acids are for removing calcium deposits and sanitizing. 

##### Detergents

You will need hot water and physical exertion to do the job. Unscented is best. Use Dawn brand. 

##### Sanitizers

Sanitizers are used to eliminate any bacteria that scrubbing and washing might not have removed. They are meant to follow thorough cleaning 

> You can't sanitize something that isn't clean

Sanitizing can be done with heat or with chemicals.

The most readily available sanitizer to use at home and in small creameries is often `chlorine`. It is available in the form of grocery store bleach. Quite often, too munch is used, leading to residue on equipment that can then lead to personal and equipment harm.

If you're going to use `bleach`, buy some cheap `chlorine` dilution test strips. This ensures the proper amount of sanitizer is being used. Use them regularly.

##### Acid Rinses

Acid, at the right strength, plays two roles in the cheese make room:

* a solvent of mineral deposits
* a residual sanitizer

For the home cheese maker, it only needs to be used periodically to prevent the buildup of what is commonly called `milkstone`.

`Milkstone` build up slowly as the minerals in milk are steadily deposited on surfaces. While most are rinsed away during cleaning, they are not all dissolved by the alkaline detergents and will eventually forma  residue on all surfaces, including plastic and stainless steel.

The goal is to remove the minerals before you see the buildup by rinsing regularly with a strong acid solution.

Initially, try using white vinegar for your rinse. If this is not sufficient, you will want to use an acid cleaner. If it works depends on how hard the water is. Hard water has higher levels of minerals.

#### Brushes and Scrubbers

You can use any type of scrub brush or scrubber, but don't use sponges, as they don't dry out between uses, and therefore are great habitats for bacteria.

If you're using the green scrub pads, watch out that they don't leave green hairs in your equipment.

### The Six Steps to Cleaning

A good cleaning regimen consists of at least four steps: 

* rinse
* wash
* acid rinse
* pre-sanitize

But lets go into more depth with the whole six steps.

##### Step 1: Pre-rinse

Immediately after using, rinse all equipment with luke warm water, about 100F (38C) to remove all visible milk and curd residues. This step is important to do before washing so the heat of the wash doesn't "cook" proteins onto the surfaces

##### Step 2: Wash

Fill the sink with very hot water and use detergent and a clean bristle brush and scrub pad to manually scour the surfaces of all equipment

##### Step 3: Rinse

Rinse with clean water. Some people like to use a sanitizing acid rinse at this stage.

##### Step 4: Air-dry

Allow all equipment to air dry between uses

##### Step 5: Sanitize

Just prior to use, sanitize all equipment by dipping in a food-surface-approved sanitizer. Most chemical sanitizers need 30 seconds of exposure to ensure proper killing of any residual germs. Alternatively, you can use hot water at 170F (77C) and immerse equipment for 5 minutes.

##### Step 6: Acid Wash/Rinse

An `acid wash` is done on a periodic basis to remove mineral deposits that are not completely removed during the daily cleaning process.

An `acid rinse` (without cleaners) can be done daily instead of the stronger periodic `acid wash`. If you choose to do a daily rinse (G' prefers this), you can perform it either just following or in place of `Step 3: Rinse`.

When doing periodic acid washes, the frequency will greatly depend on the amount of calcium and minerals in your water, as well as the frequency of cheesemaking.
