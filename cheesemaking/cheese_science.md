### Milk

All milk is made up of sugars, fat, protein, minerals, vitamins and enzymes.

##### Milk Sugar

Milk sugar provides food for the bacteria in the starter culture which is added to the milk. The starter culture digests the sugar and produces acid. This acid production begins the process that will eventually turn the milk into cheese. 

Learning to regulate this acid production is key to making great cheese.

The sugar in milk is called `lactose`. Lactose is made up of `glucose` and `galactose`. 

It is the breakdown and consumption of `lactose` that produces acid - `lactic acid`. Without the presence of acid, the production of cheese cannot occur.

**Enzymes**

Enzymes act upon other substances to break a bond. The enzyme `lactase` is required to break the `lactose` into digestible sugars.

During cheesemaking, `lactose` is broken down through the actions of certain bacteria, which are usually added to the milk in the form of a starter culture. 

As the bacteria consumes the milk sugars through the process of fermentation - first `lactose`, then `glucose` and `galactose` - lactic acid is produced. 

##### Fermentation defined

Fermentation is the process through which carbohydrates and sugars are broken down into by-products such as alcohol, the gas carbon dioxide, and organic acids. The definition for the type of fermentation occurring, which is based on what is being fermented, is called the `substrate`. Fermentation is one of the oldest methods of preserving food, next to drying and salting.

##### Lactic Acid a.k.a. Lactate

The term `lactate` is used interchangeably with `lactic acid` (i.e. `lactate` == `lactic acid`). It is not to be confused with the verb `lactate.`

There are two variations of `lactic acid`, and it is the **starter culture** that can produce one or both of these types.

The two varieties of `lactate` are `D-lactate` and `L-lactate`. 

`D-lactate` can also create two other by-products that influence cheese making: the alcohol `ethanol` and the gas `carbon dioxide` (used in making Swiss cheese). 

In addition to fermenting `lactose` into two types of `lactic acid`, starter bacteria also vary in their ability to ferment the two simple sugars, `galactose` and `glucose`. If only one of the  two is completely fermented, residual sugar will remain in the cheese curd. This remaining sugar can help feed other bacteria during the first stages of aging, which is desirable in some cheeses.

For most pressed cheeses all sugar will have been metabolized and utilized after about two weeks of aging. 

There is virtually no `lactose` left in aged cheeses, so lactose intolerant people can happily consume it. In fresher and more moist cheeses, it is more likely that some `lactose` will exist, so lactose intolerant people should not consume them.

The later an animal is in her lactation cycle, the less lactose there is in her milk, and the more protein and fat there is. This can influence the rate at which acid is developed by the starter culture, as there is simply less fuel for the process.

##### Crystals ("Crunchies") in Cheese

There are a couple of types of crystals that can occur in cheese, and are known as the **crunchies**. The first type is formed from the amino acid `tyrosine` and is desireable is certain cheeses. `Tyrosine` crystals typically form in high-protein, long-aged cheeses such as Parmesan and aged Gouda. 

The second type of crystal is formed when calcium combines with `residual lactate` to form `calcium lactate crystals` - which are considered a **defect**, and are commonly found on the surface of cheeses like cheddar.

##### Milk Fat - Filling Out The Flavor

The role of Milk fat is to provide an appealing texture, well-rounded flavor, and wonderful aromas. The amount, composition, and quality of milk fat in cheese are all important factors to the cheesemaking process, and can be somewhat manipulated by the cheesemaker.

##### Anatomy of Milk Fat Globules

Milk fat globules are surrounded by the `milk fat globule membrane` (aka `MFGM`), which contains most of the enzymes that occur naturally in milk, besides `lipase` which breaks down fats/lipids and does not exist in `MFGM`. Of course, if `lipase` existed in the `MFGM`, it would destroy the globule.

The inside of the membrane contains the fats, mostly `triglycerides` (aka `tryaglycerols`). A glyceride is a glycerol molecule, which is the basic model for all fats, bonded to one, two or three fatty acids. Triclycerides (3 bonded fats) are the fats that make up most of the food oils and fats that we consume. 

##### Creaming

Milk fat globules are less dense than the surrounding milk fluid, which causes them to float to the top of the milk and form a layer of cream. This process is called `creaming`.

##### Homogenization

`Homogenization` is a mechanical process that aims to stop fat globules from `creaming`. It involves sending the milk under high pressure through a screen with openings smaller that the fat globules. Goat, sheep and buffalo milk are NOT naturally homogenized. They just don't have cryoglobulins, so `creaming` occurs **much** slower. Homogenized milk tends to not drain and lose whey during the draining process, making it a bad choice for some types of cheeses.

##### Cold Storage of Milk 

Cold storage of milk causes a loss of protein from inside the micelles into the liquid portion of the milk, where it is referred to as soluble protein. Mastitic milk from infected udders and colostrum (first milk excreted by a new mother) have higher levels of soluble protein making them bad for cheesemaking.

##### Damaged Fats in Milk

The fat in milk can be easily damaged before and during the cheesemaking process, leading to rancid flavors. Problematic bacteria can enter the milk during the milking process, though this can be prevented or limited by proper sanitation during milking and processing, and rapid chilling to limit the growth of these bacteria. Too much mechanical agitation from rough milk pumps or excessive stirring can also cause premature fat breakdown. Milk that is mastitic (from an udder with some level of infection) will have a lower fat content than normal.

##### Relationship between Fat and Protein in Cheese

During cheesemaking, you are attempting to trap fat globules in a protein network. The correct amount and type of protein is required to catch the butterfat.

##### Importance of Protein in Cheese

Cheese needs protein to create its structure. It's a network of protein that will trap the fat and transform the liquid milk into curd. The protein supplies much of the valuable nutrition that cheeses provide. 

##### Types of Protein in Cheese

Milk protein is classified into two main types: Cheese proteins (aka **Caseins**) and **Whey** proteins. Caseins can be captured during the coagulation process while the whey proteins remain in the fluid by-product of cheesemaking, whey.

##### Digestibility

Aged cheeses tend to be more easily digested than fresh cheeses and milk, due to the lack of lactose and the breakdown of protein into its smaller components. 

##### Anatomy of Cheese Proteins

A cluster of proteins in milk is called the `Casein Micelle`, and they float suspended in the milk. There are two main groups of `caseins` - `Alpha Caseins` and `Beta Caseins`. Toward the outside of the clusters exists another milk protein called `Kappa Casein`.

##### Milk allergies

People allergic to milk are usually allergic to Alpha Casein, which is usually more prevalent in cows milk. 

##### Coagulating Milk Proteins Using Rennet

Rennet contains an enzyme (e.g. chymosin) that splits/cleaves the chain of amino acids in `Kappa Casein` (? Might be alpha, not kappa) from the outside of the `micelle` (like a haircut). Next, the rennet exposes water-hating (hydrophobic behavior), causing the `micelles` to repel water and start attracting each other and bonding together with the help of calcium phosphate in the liquid portion of the milk. A thickened curd mass (aka **Coagulum**) can now form, and the cheese becomes possible.

##### Coagulating Milk Proteins Using Acid

Coagulation can also be achieved using acid, which can be an added (e.g. Vinegar or Lemon Juice) or by the production of `lactic acid` by a starter culture. As the pH of milk drops close to `4.6`, Caseins lose their ability to repel each other. Calcium Phosphate which was formerly bonded within the micelle, becomes soluble in the acidic environment. All this produces a condition in which a Coagulum is formed, but it is different in texture and structure from a rennet-produced coagulum. 

##### The Development of Flavor in Cheese

The process of breaking amino acid chains causes the development of flavor and texture in cheese.

##### Minerals in Milk

Minerals in milk are often called `Salts` or `Ash`. `Salts` is a chemistry term for minerals, and `Ash` is used because the salts can be separated from the fluid milk by burning off the liquid portion, leaving an `ash`.

`Calcium` and `Phosphate` are the two minerals in milk of primary importance to cheesemaking. About 2/3 of `calcium` in milk resides inside `protein micelles` (aka `Colloidal Calcium`). Anything that limits the amount of colloidal calcium in the milk will limit the potential for a good curd to set. E.g. When milk is stored at cold temperatures, some of the `colloidal calcium` leaves the `micelles`, and is unable to help with coagulation.

##### Calcium and Cheese

`Calcium`'s role in cheesemaking is to assist in forming a firm curd that traps fat and will hold up to stirring, pressing and stretching of the curd. It acts like a glue.

The cheesemaker can manipulate the `calcium` content and type in cheeses to assist the cheesemaking process to be more successful, or to create different types of cheeses.

Calcium and other minerals will dissolve in the presence of acid of the right strength. 

This mineral balance is directly linked to the cheese's texture - a mineralized cheese is pliable and long in texture, while a demineralized cheese has a short crumbly texture, aka `friable`

The cheesemaker has the ability to control the final calcium content of the cheese, which is critical for texture.

##### Vitamins in Cheese

Vitamins play a minimal role in cheesemaking. `Carotene` gives cow's milk cheese a yellow color. Goat, sheep and buffalo milk don't contain carotene, so cheese made from these milks are whiter by comparison. 

Artificially orange cheddars use the natural pigment `Annatto` to achieve their color. `Riboflavin` - a B Vitamin - gives the greenish tint to `Whey`. 

##### Enzymes - The Heroes of Cheesemaking

Enzymes are named after the substance they acto on and usually end with the suffix `ase`. `Lipases` are enzymes that break down `lipids`, aka fats. `Proteases` (aka proteinases) break down proteins. These two enzyme groups are the most important to cheesemakers. 

`Lipase` is present in milk, and is called `native` or `milk lipase`. `Native milk lipase` is mostly destroyed by pasteurization, while `lipase` produced by microorganisms usually survives the heat treatment.

The breakdown of the fat molecules in milk is something that the cheesemaker wants to happen at the appropriate time, which is usually during aging. If the breakdown of fats happens at the wrong time, rancid/off flavors can enter the cheese.

`Proteases` also occur naturally in milk, like `Lipase`. These are mostly destroyed by pasteurization, but additional proteases are provided by the use of rennet and starter culture bacteria. This process helps develop flavor and texture of the cheese, and can only occur in the vat and on the aging shelf.

##### Culture

Milk is a nutritious environment attractive to many different types of microorganisms, some which we want, and others that we don't. When using raw milk for cheesemaking, there will already be some bacteria in the milk, but added culture is still important. If using pasteurized milk, choosing and using cultures becomes even more critical. 

The role of `culture` is to help transform milk into cheese. Cultures are usually bacteria, but they can also be yeasts and molds. When they enter the story, they rapidly begin to consume the milk sugar `lactose` and turn it into `lactic acid`. It is this acid that will preserve the cheese during aging or stage, as well as create flavor. 

The second role of cultures is to die, as when this happens, their cell walls leave behind enzymes that will further break down proteins and fats into tasty elements.

Finally, cultures help create surfaces and textures that make cheeses unique. 

The term `Cheese Culture` covers three main types of organisms - bacteria, yeasts and molds. 

Some of these are added to the milk (starter culture), some exist in the milk or enter it accidentally (native culture), and others are added at varying stages of the process (ripening cultures). 

##### Starter Culture

There are four main ways to add starter culture to milk:

1. Freeze-dried `Direct Vat Set` (DVS), aka `Direct Vat Inoculation` (DVI), aka `Direct Set` (DS). 
2. `Mother Culture` - oldest method. time consuming and unpredictable
3. `Bulk Starter` - essentially `mother culture` that someone else has prepared and sells as frozen pellets
4. `Whey Culture` - whey from the previous day's cheese making used to start the next batch

The most popular form re starter culture is **freeze-dried, powdered `direct vat set` culture**.

`DVS` cultures have several benefits over other starter cultures. They are easy to store (regular freezer), reliable (calculations have been done for you), less labor intensive (it is ready to use).

You must check the temperature that the culture likes staying at (warm, hot, or even cold). Cold-loving bacteria are not desired and should never be added to milk.

Most culture companies provide advice on the label, although there is no perfect bacteria or blend of bacteria for any single cheese, so you will see overlap.

##### Raw Milk Cheeses

Raw milk will always contain bacteria, mold spores and yeasts. These "native" organisms enter the milk during and after milk collection from the udder.

Milk in the udder itself is believed to be sterile. Microorganisms grown on the outside, though. 

The major harmful bacteria in raw milk are `Clostridia`, `Campylobacter`, `Staphylococcus aureus`, `Listeria monocytogenes` and `Salmonella`. These can cause paralysis and even death.

##### Beneficial Bacteria

Many native bacteria in milk are known as `nonstarter lactic acid bacteria` (NSLAB). NSLAB do not produce large amounts of acid, so they are not helpful as starter cultures, but they are considered highly beneficial and help raw milk cheeses develop unique flavor and ripen faster. Currently they are being developed commercially to be added back into milk.


##### Ripening Culture

`Ripening cultures` are also known as `secondary` or `adjunct` cultures.

`Starter culture` gets the process going, but `ripening culture` are the bacteria, molds and yeasts that are added during aging and ripening. 

An example of ripening culture is the white mold that produces Camembert and Brie.

NSLAB also serve as secondary ripening cultures, especially in raw-milk cheeses. 

##### Classifying Cultures

Starter bacteria are grouped by several methods. 

The most common is their ability to grow at certain temperatures.
Another is their ability to break lactose down into one or more varieties of lactic acid. 

Those that can break lactose into more than one by-product are further divided by their ability to metabolize another milk component - `citrate` - at the same time into desirable by-products. 

#### Phage - The Bane of Cheesemakers

`Phage`, short for `bacteriophage`, are virus particles that infect starter lactic acid bacteria. 

They use the bacteria as a host to replicate themselves, attach to receptor sites on the surface of the soon-to-be-host cells, then inject their own DNA into the cell. 

The cell immediately begins replicating the invader's DNA and grows a bunch of new "baby" phage. Once the cell can no longer hold its new crop, the `phage` release an enzyme that blows the cell open and sets the now greatly increased number of attackers loose on more unsuspecting bacteria. 

In the best case, this will lead to slow acid development in the vat, but in the worst case, it causes a `dead vat`, in which no acid production occurs and the entire batch is lost. 

Worse still, the entire cheese making process must be stopped until the `phage` can be destroyed, or a new resistant starter culture can be found.

There is another form of attack that is not so aggressive and can actually "immunize" the host cell. Instead of replicating, the `phage` joins its DNA with the chromosome of the host and remains part of the host. Now that the DNA are combined, the cell is immune from the former, cell-bursting form of `phage`.

`Phage` are very hardy, and can survive for many years even though frozen. They are difficult to kill, and prefer raw milk. They are present more in whey than other milk components. 

##### Phage - Prevention

1. Remove whey from the cheese making area as soon as possible. This is the first and best strategy towards phage prevention.

2. Don't return whey to the farm where the milk was made, as it could contaminate the milk at the farm.

3. `Chlorine` is a highly affective phagicide, when used to sanitize equipment and floors that had contact with the whey. This should only be done *after* cheese making. Special attention should be paid to cracks, nooks and crevices where whey could sit and develop a phage population. 

##### Lipase - Extra Flavor

Lipase is an enzyme that breaks down fats into short-chain fatty acids and helps create flavor and aroma.

Rennet used to be made from an actual piece of the stomach lining of an animal. This type of rennet also contains lipase. 

The lipase in stomach lining is much stronger than native milk lipase. 

Calf lipase is the mildest, kid is intermediate, lamb is the strongest. You can also buy blends.

Adding extra lipase in the fashion is *always* optional, but it is the only way to truly duplicate traditional cheeses.

Vegetarian-based lipase is not really available for artisan home-made cheese. It exists for larger industrial processed cheeses, though.

#### Calcium Chloride - keeping things in balance

Every cheesemaker should have a supply of `calcium chloride`. 

`Calcium Chloride` (CaCl2) is a clear, bitter, weakly acidic mineral salt usually sold in a properly diluted solution that is ready to use. 

Calcium chloride is added to the milk before rennet, never after. 

It helps reduce the coagulation time and create a firmer curd. 

Some cheesemakers use it when working with goat's milk, but it should definitely be used whenever working with store-bought milk of any kind. 

It can also assist when working with milk from animals late into their milking cycle, e.g. in the fall or winter.

Too much can lead to a hard curd with a bitter taste.

Because calcium plays such a big role in the formation of the coagulum as well as the final texture of cheese, anything that upsets the balance and volume of calcium will affect every stage of the cheesemaking process.

Using `calcium chloride` correctly can ensure this balance is kept, and the cheese comes out as it's supposed to.

Here are some situations when you'd want to use calcium chloride:

##### Cold Storage

Cold storage of milk can cause the `casein micelle` to lose some of its `colloidal calcium`.  This can cause a weak curd during coagulation.

##### Low Protein Level

Some milk is naturally lower in total protein. As a result, the `casein` content and the calcium content can be lower. Goat's milk typically has a lower ratio of casein to whey protein and the least of the best cheesemaking protein Alpha SI. Again, this may cause a weak coagulum.

##### High Somatic Cell Count

Somatic cells are white blood cells that migrate into the udder to fight off infection.

High somatic cell counts that correlate with mastitis (udder infection) can lead to a high starting PH of the milk, which can cause longer coagulation time. Somatic cells also introduce enzymes that will damage the protein micelles, causing a loss of colloidal calcium.

##### High Enzymatic Activity

Enzymes in the milk can increase in volume toward the end of lactation and during winter. Goats seem more prone to this than cows. This increase can damage the protein micelle and cause a loss of calcium, a longer coagulation time and a softer curd. 


#### Rennet - Animal, Vegetable & Microbial


##### Animal

Rennet is made from the stomach lining of a calf, kid or lamb that has not yet eaten solid food. It contains two enzymes, `chymosin` and `pepsin`, that both coagulate milk in the baby's stomach, stopping it from passing through too quickly and allowing the baby to absorb the nutrients. 

`Pepsin` is the main ingredient in junket rennet tablets that you can find in most grocery stores, but junket rennet is a poor choice for cheesemaking as it adds bitterness and contains chemicals that have no business being in cheese.

The gold standard of coagulants is `calf rennet`. Kid and lamb are superior in quality, but are generally not available for purchase. 

##### Microbial

Perfect for making vegetarian or kosher cheese.

Most microbial rennet is produced by the microbe `Rhizomucor miehei`, aka `Mucor miehei`. 

Microbial rennet has an undeserved reputation for causing bitterness in cheese. 

##### Fermented Chymosin

This coagulant is produced using genetically modified microbes into which the animal gene for producing `chymosin` has been inserted. It behaves very similarly to animal rennet in its ability to coagulate milk, but differs slightly regarding aging.

##### Vegetable Rennets

As opposed to microbial rennet, vegetable rennet is made from plants. The most well known are from the thistle family. This type of coagulant works best with high-fat, high-protein milk. It can cause bitterness. Other plants able to produce rennet are: fig trees, nettles, burdock, hogweed and Lady's Bedstraw.

Plant rennets do not have the coagulating power of animal and microbial rennets, but can be interesting.

#### The Process of Coagulation

The first job of rennet is to coagulate the milk. 

Enzymes in the rennet interact with the protein clusters in milk. Other factors play an important role, such as `pH`, temperature, amount of calcium in the milk, and the type and quality of Casein (milk protein).

Rennet is also important for aging cheese and helping it develop flavor, texture and aroma.

(If you really need more info on this, go to Chapter 1 Page 26).

#### Salt - The Final Key Ingredient

Salt, aka `sodium chloride` is very important in the creation of superior cheese.

The first job of salt is to slow down, then bring to a halt, the production of acid in cheese. It does this by stopping the starter culture bacteria, which are sensitive to salt, from growing. When they stop growing, they also stop producing lactic acid. 

By stopping the `pH` at the right spot, you help ensure the right finished flavor and texture in cheese. 

Salt helps draw whey out of the cheese. This aids in finishing the draining of the curds. When properly drained, just the right amount of moisture remains, helping to limit the growth of microorganisms. This helps flavor and texture.

Salt also helps protect the outside of the cheese (salted or brined cheeses) by preventing mold and bacterial growth on the surface of the cheese. It also hardens the surface by dehydration, so that the cheese maintains its form, and is less delicate during turning.

Salt can also encourage salt-tolerant molds, such as white molds, to grow where their presence is desired.

Salt also helps bring out flavor.

##### Factors influencing the rate of salting

The temperature of the curd, especially in milled curds such as cheddar, will affect how salt is absorbed. 

The first application of salt will flush whey out of the curd and can rinse away the salt. So when dry-salting curds and wheels, recipes often call for two or more applications instead of using the total amount of salt all at one time. 

A cheese that has a higher fat content will impede salt uptake, not just at the surface of cheese, but throughout the interior. The large fat globules act as a physical barrier to the movement of `sodium chloride` in the cheese.

High fat cheeses are often salted many times for this reason, or kept longer in brine. 

##### Salt-Tolerant and Salt-Sensitive Microorganisms

Some bad bacteria are not inhibited by the addition of 2-5% salt that is normal for cheeses.

Chief among these bacteria are the `coliforms`, a large family of bacteria, some of which are responsive for `early blowing` in cheese. 

##### The Effect Of Calcium

Much of the cheese's final texture is due to minerals, especially calcium (mostly `calcium phosphate`). Low calcium content equals crumbly, and high calcium equals pliable - e.g. feta vs cheddar. Calcium is the "glue" that holds the protein matrix together. As calcium leaves the curd, the protein networks collapse, creating a fractured texture.

So what causes the curd to lose or retain `calcium`? Acid! As the `pH` of the curd decreases, the calcium will because more soluble and leave the curd along with the whey. If the acid level drops too low, too much calcium is lost. 

This loss can occur in the vat or during aging.
