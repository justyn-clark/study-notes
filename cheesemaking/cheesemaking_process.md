### The Cheese Making Process

#### The Process of Ripening

During ripening, the bacteria in the starter culture begins to populate the milk, consume the milk sugar (lactose), and produce lactic acid. Depending on what else occurs during the process, the ripening time must be of a length that helps, not hinders the desired acid production during the rest of the make, and the goal pH or titratable acidity (TA) at draining.

After ripening and just before coagulation, you may want to add additional ingredients like coloring (Annatto), calcium chloride, lipase, or flavored liquid from herbs, seeds, smoke or hot peppers.

#### The process of Coagulation

Once the ripening goal has been reached (time passed or acid-level change), we add the coagulant. 

Rennet (animal or microbial) comes as either liquid or a tablet. Liquid rennet is much easier to measure accurately. Liquid rennet is easier to use especially in larger cooks.

Make sure to check if the rennet (especially microbial) is single strength or double strength. Use half the requested dose if it is double strength.

There are different amounts of rennet called for in different cheeses. Here's why:

* Temp of milk at rennetting: coagulant will work faster at slightly warmer temps, making flocculation time faster.
* pH at time of rennetting: the more acidic the milk, the faster the coagulation time
* The goal total coagulation time: This is a combination of desired texture at cutting and acid development during coagulation.

##### Dilution

Liquid rennet must be diluted in **cool, non chlorinated water** before use. If chlorinated water is used, the chlorine will attack the rennet. Heat will also deactivate it.

Don't mix the rennet with the water until just before use - because light exposure, contaminants, etc.
