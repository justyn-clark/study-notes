### The Cheese Making Process

#### The Process of Ripening

During ripening, the bacteria in the starter culture begins to populate the milk, consume the milk sugar (lactose), and produce lactic acid. Depending on what else occurs during the process, the ripening time must be of a length that helps, not hinders the desired acid production during the rest of the make, and the goal pH or titratable acidity (TA) at draining.

After ripening and just before coagulation, you may want to add additional ingredients like coloring (Annatto), calcium chloride, lipase, or flavored liquid from herbs, seeds, smoke or hot peppers.

#### The process of Coagulation

Once the ripening goal has been reached (time passed or acid-level change), we add the coagulant. 

Rennet (animal or microbial) comes as either liquid or a tablet. Liquid rennet is much easier to measure accurately. Liquid rennet is easier to use especially in larger cooks.

Make sure to check if the rennet (especially microbial) is single strength or double strength. Use half the requested dose if it is double strength.

There are different amounts of rennet called for in different cheeses. Here's why:

* Temp of milk at rennetting: coagulant will work faster at slightly warmer temps, making flocculation time faster.
* pH at time of rennetting: the more acidic the milk, the faster the coagulation time
* The goal total coagulation time: This is a combination of desired texture at cutting and acid development during coagulation.

##### Dilution

Liquid rennet must be diluted in **cool, non chlorinated water** before use. If chlorinated water is used, the chlorine will attack the rennet. Heat will also deactivate it.

Don't mix the rennet with the water until just before use - because light exposure, contaminants, etc.

##### Adding the Coagulant

The style of stirring and the length of time stirring the coagulant into the milk are vital. As soon as the rennet touches the milk, it starts working. The more evenly and effectively that the rennet is incorporated into the milk, the better. 

Once mixed, it is critical that the milk stop moving in the vat and remain as still as possible until coagulation is complete.

For these reasons, rennet solution should be dispersed over the milk by pouring it over a perforated ladle or using a "garden" sprinkle can (when adding to large vats).

The stirring motion should be "up and down" instead of circular. You don't want to create a whirlpool effect, because the milk will keep moving, causing problems with coagulation.

Once you stop stirring, you can use a flat ladle to help the milk stop moving. 

You should also log the time when you added the coagulant and how long you stirred it for in a logbook. This is essential for the next step.

##### Cutting the curd

The firmness of the coagulated milk when you cut it "fixes" the type of curd you will end up with later on in the make. So if you know the goal, you will know at what firmness to cut and what size to cut the curd. 

As the coagulum sits for longer, the protein structure will become more firm and granular, so when you attempt to cut an extra-firm mass into small pieces, it will create curds with rough, granular sides with more surface area.

If the curds have a rough surface, they will lose more butterfat into the whey through the jagged parts that stick out from the main part of each curd. 

So the goal is a **smoothly cut curd of the desired size**.

##### Size of the curd

The goal of cutting the coagulated milk into evenly sized pieces (curds) is to expose an equal amount of surface area so the curds can shrink by losing whey. The more even in size you can cut the curds, the better.

The size at which curds are cut also influences fat retention. The smaller the curds, the more fat is lost, no matter the original fat content of the milk.

When you cut the curds, areas of the protein network are exposed, and the fat trapped within leaks out into the whey.

##### Determining when to cut

Here are two methods to determine when to cut the curd.

1. Observe the milk for the point at which the enzymatic phase ends and the coagulation phase begins. I.e. observe the flocculation point, using that time to determine the total coagulation time. 

2. Watch for the ideal texture for cutting, or the "clean break".

##### What is Flocculation

A `floc` is a clumped particle. 

The enzymatic phase is when enzymes knock off the outside water-loving kappa-casein projections. Flocculation occurs when this enzymatic phase is 75 to 80 percent complete and clumping becomes noticeable.

There are several techniques for checking for flocculation.

1. You can dip a dry knife or curd blade into the milk, draw itv back out, and observe the surface for little flecks (those are flocks).

2. Float a jelly-jar lid on the surface of the milk and note when in no longer spins freely. 

3. Remove a small sample of milk in a clear container, swirl it, and see if flocks form on the sides of the container. 

By watching for flocculation, you can judge the total cut time better than by just watching for a "clean break"

Once you see flocculation, the time is noted, then multiplied by a specific factor (see Table 2-2, p. 47).

**The resulting number is the time from adding the coagulant to cutting.** 

#### Testing milk for coagulation before making cheese

(this is so cool!!)

Here is a test using flocculation which checks if the milk is suitable for cheese making. 

1. Mix 24 milliliters cool water with 1.25 milliliters double-strength rennet.
2. Warm 1/4 cup milk to 92F (33C) in a clear measuring cup
3. Add 10 milliliters of rennet mixture to warm milk wile swirling milk. 
4. Time the seconds it takes for small flocs to form on sides of measuring cup.

If it takes more than 20 seconds to flocculate, there is an issue with the milk. 

Repeat the test, but this time add 1/8 teaspoon calcium chloride to the milk. If flocculation time improves, then add calcium chloride to the cheese milk at the recommended rate.

##### How to Check for a Clean Break

A clean break is a good test to use in addition to Flocculation testing.

A clean break is not a singular moment in the vat.

Remember, the proteins are knitting together to form a network which strengthens as it grows. If you cut too soon, the structure will mush instead of cut and you will lose the fat into the whey. Alternatively, if you wait too long, it will become so firm that it will resist the knife and tear rather than cut cleanly. So the optimal cutting time is a range, not a moment.

**Methods for checking for a clean break**

1. Crook your index or middle finger, insert it into the curd up to the second knuckle and lift slowly
2. **(Preferred)** - Use a knife, cut a slit, insert the knife - flat side up- at an angle just behind the slit and under the uncut portion of the front of the cut. Then lift slowly and see if the cut seam expands forward. As the curd mass gives way to the pressure below, it will part. As it parts, observe the sides of the tear and the liquid that escapes. Are the sides smooth or jagged? Is the whey white or yellow/green? If the sides are smooth and the liquid is more yellow/green than white, the curd is ready to cut. 

If the cut time is off from its goal, adjust the amount of rennet for the next batch.

##### Cooking

Some cheeses (soft fresh cheeses and bloomy rinds) are made *without* the curd going through a phase of heating and stirring. For most of these types, the cur is held at the ripening temperature until the mass has achieved the goal acid development and textures, at which point it is ladled, scooped, or drained right into the forms. 

Almost all other hard cheeses will go through a phase where the curd is heated and stirred. This is sometimes called `scalding` instead of `cooking`. 

Increasing the temperature of the whey will cause the curds to shrink and lose more whey. If this happens too quickly, it will cause the curd surface to dry prematurely, thereby trapping whey inside the curd. As such, temp increases are usually done in slow increments, with the initial increases being done the slowest to give the inside of the curd a chance to lose the whey at the same rate as the surface.

As the temp increases, the bacteria will respond by producing more or less acid, depending on the type of the starter bacteria. 

Meaning, **you can adjust the rate of acid development by adjusting the temperature in the vat.**

##### Stirring

You generally stir the curd gently, meaning you stir the curd as gently as is needed to prevent the curds from "shattering", or breaking into tiny pieces. 

Sometimes you can stir the curd with a cheese ladle, but sometimes you'll need to shake the pot first to agitate the curds.
