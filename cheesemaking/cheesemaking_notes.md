This work consists of my notes from reading **Mastering Artisan Cheesemaking** by **Gianaclis Caldwell**, which can be purchased on [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com)

### Milk

All milk is made up of sugars, fat, protein, minerals, vitamins and enzymes.

##### Milk Sugar

Milk sugar provides food for the bacteria in the starter culture which is added to the milk. The starter culture digests the sugar and produces acid. This acid production begins the process that will eventually turn the milk into cheese. 

Learning to regulate this acid production is key to making great cheese.

The sugar in milk is called `lactose`. Lactose is made up of `glucose` and `galactose`. 

It is the breakdown and consumption of `lactose` that produces acid - `lactic acid`. Without the presence of acid, the production of cheese does not occur.

Enzymes act upon other substances to break a bond. The enzyme `lactase` is required to break the `lactose` into digestible sugars.

During cheesemaking, `lactose` is broken down through the actions of certain bacteria, which are usually added to the milk in the form of a starter culture. 

As the bacteria consumes the milk sugars through the process of fermentation - first `lactose`, then `glucose` and `galactose` - lactic acid is produced. 

##### Fermentation defined

Fermentation is the process through which carbohydrates and sugars are broken down into by-products such as alcohol, the gas carbon dioxide, and organic acids. The definition for the type of fermentation occurring, which is based on what is being fermented, is called the `substrate`. Fermentation is one of the oldest methods of preserving food, next to drying and salting.

##### Lactic Acid a.k.a. Lactate

The term `lactate` is used interchangeably with `lactic acid` (i.e. `lactate` == `lactic acid`). It is not to be confused with the verb `lactate.`

There are two variations of `lactic acid`, and it is the **starter culture** that can produce one or both of these types.

The two varieties of `lactate` are `D-lactate` and `L-lactate`. 

`D-lactate` can also create two other by-products that influence cheese making: the alcohol `ethanol` and the gas `carbon dioxide` (used in making Swiss cheese). 

In addition to fermenting `lactose` into two types of `lactic acid`, starter bacteria also vary in their ability to ferment the two simple sugars, `galactose` and `glucose`. If only one of the  two is completely fermented, residual sugar will remain in the cheese curd. This remaining sugar can help feed other bacteria during the first stages of aging, which is desirable in some cheeses.

For most pressed cheeses all sugar will have been metabolized and utilized after about two weeks of aging. 

There is virtually no `lactose` left in aged cheeses, so lactose intolerant people can happily consume it. In fresher and more moist cheeses, it is more likely that some `lactose` will exist, so lactose intolerant people should not consume them.

The later an animal is in her lactation cycle, the less lactose there is in her milk, and the more protein and fat there is. This can influence the rate at which acid is developed by the starter culture, as there is simply less fuel for the process.

##### Crystals ("Crunchies") in Cheese

There are a couple of types of crystals that can occur in cheese, and are known as the **crunchies**. The first type is formed from the amino acid `tyrosine` and is desireable is certain cheeses. `Tyrosine` crystals typically form in high-protein, long-aged cheeses such as Parmesan and aged Gouda. 

The second type of crystal is formed when calcium combines with `residual lactate` to form `calcium lactate crystals` - which are considered a **defect**, and are commonly found on the surface of cheeses like cheddar.

##### Milk Fat - Filling Out The Flavor

The role of Milk fat is to provide an appealing texture, well-rounded flavor, and wonderful aromas. The amount, composition, and quality of milk fat in cheese are all important factors to the cheesemaking process, and can be somewhat manipulated by the cheesemaker.

##### Anatomy of Milk Fat Globules

Milk fat globules are surrounded by the `milk fat globule membrane` (aka `MFGM`), which contains most of the enzymes that occur naturally in milk, besides `lipase` which breaks down fats/lipids and does not exist in `MFGM`. Of course, if `lipase` existed in the `MFGM`, it would destroy the globule.

The inside of the membrane contains the fats, mostly `triglycerides` (aka `tryaglycerols`). A glyceride is a glycerol molecule, which is the basic model for all fats, bonded to one, two or three fatty acids. Triclycerides (3 bonded fats) are teh fats that make up most of th food oils and fats that we consume. 

##### Creaming

Milk fat globules are less dense than the surrounding milk fluid, which causes them to float to the top of the milk and form a layer of cream. This process is called `creaming`.

##### Homogenization

`Homogenization` is a mechanical process that aims to stop fat globules from `creaming`. I involves sending the milk under high pressure through a screen with openings smaller that the fat globules. Goat, sheep and buffalo milk are NOT naturally homogenized. They just don't have cryoglobulins, so `creaming` occurs **much** slower. Homogenized milk tends to not drain and lose whey during the draining process, making it a bad choice for some types of cheeses.

##### Cold Storage of Milk 

Cold storage of milk causes a loss of protein from inside the micelles into the liquid portion of the milk, where it is referred to as soluble protein. Mastitic milk from infected udders and colostrum (first milk excreted by a new mother) have higher levels of soluble protein making them bad for cheesemaking.

##### Damaged Fats in Milk

The fat in milk can be easily damaged before and during the cheesemaking process, leading to rancid flavors. Problematic bacteria can enter the milk during the milking process, though this can be prevented or limited by proper sanitation during milking and processing, and rapid chilling to limit the growth of these bacteria. Too much mechanical agitation from rough milk pumps or excessive stirring can also cause premature fat breakdown. Milk that is mastitic (from an udder with some level of infection) will have a lower fat content than normal.

##### Relationship between Fat and Protein in Cheese

During cheesemaking, you are attempting to trap fat globules in a protein network. The correct amount and type of protein is required to catch the butterfat.

##### Importance of Protein in Cheese

Cheese needs protein to create its structure. It's a network of protein that will trap the fat and transform the liquid milk into curd. The protein supplies much of the valuable nutrition that cheeses provide. 

##### Types of Protein in Cheese

Milk protein is classified into two main types: Cheese proteins (aka **Caseins**) and **Whey** proteins. Caseins can be captured during the coagulation process while the whey proteins remain in the fluid by-product of cheesemaking, whey.

##### Digestibility

Aged cheeses tend to be more easily digested than fresh cheeses and milk, due to the lack of lactose adn the breakdown of protein into its samller components. 

##### Anatomy of Cheese Proteins

A cluster of proteins in milk is called the Casein Micelle, and they float suspended in the milk. There are two main groups of `caseins` - `Alpha Caseins` and `Beta Caseins`. Toward the outside of the clusters exists another milk protein called `Kappa Casein`.

##### Milk allergies

People allergic to milk are usually allergic to Alpha Casein, which is usually more prevalent in cows milk. 

##### Coagulating Milk Proteins Using Rennet

Rennet contains an enzyme (e.g. chymosin) that splits/cleaves the chain of amino acids in `Kappa Casein` from the outside of the `micelle` (like a haircut). Next, the rennet exposes water-hating (hydrophobic behavior), causing the `micelles` to repel water and start attracting each other and bonding together with the help of calcium phosphate in the liquid portion of the milk. A thickened curd mass (aka **Coagulum**) can now form, and the cheese becomes possible.

##### Coagulating Milk Proteins Using Acid

Coagulation can also be achieved using acid, which can be an added (e.g. Vinegar or Lemon Juice). or by the production of `lactic acid` by a starter culture. As the pH of milk drops close to `4.6`, Caseins their ability to repel each other. Calcium Phosphate which was formerly bonded within the micelle, becomes soluble in the acidic environment. All this produces a condition in which a Coagulum is formed, but it is different in texture and structure from a rennet-produced coagulum. 

##### The Development of Flavor in Cheese

The process of breaking amino acid chains causes the development of flavor and texture in cheese.

##### Minerals in Milk

Minerals in milk are often called `Salts` or `Ash`. `Salts` is a chemistry term for minerals, and `Ash` is used because the salts can be separated from the fluid milk by burning off the liquid portion, leaving an `ash`.

`Calcium` and `Phosphate` are the two minerals in milk of primary importance to cheesemaking. About 2/3 of `calcium` in milk resudes inside `protein micelles` (aka `Colloidal Calcium`). Anything that limits the amount of colloidal calcium in the milk will limit the potential for a good curd to set. E.g. When milk is stored at cold temperatures, some of the `colloidal calcium` leaves the `micelles`, and is unable to help with coagulation.

##### Calcium and Cheese

`Calcium`'s role in cheesemaking is to assist in forming a firm curd the traps fat and will hold up to stirring, pressing and stretching of the curd. 

The cheesemaker can manipulate the `calcium` content and type in cheeses to assist the cheesemaking process to be more successful, or to create different types of cheeses.

Calcium and other minerals will dissolve in the presence of acid of the right strength. 

This mineral balance is directly linked to the cheese's texture - a mineralized cheese is pliable and long in texture, while a demineralized cheese has a short crumbly texture, aka `friable`

The cheesemaker has the ability to control the final calcium content of the cheese, which is critical for texture.

##### Vitamins in Cheese

Vitamins play a minimal role in cheesemaking. `Carotene` gives cow's milk cheese a yellow color. Goat, sheep and buffalo milk don't contain carotene, so cheese made from these milks are whiter by comparison. 

Artificially orange cheddars use the natural pigment `Annatto` to achieve their color. `Riboflavin` - a B Vitamin - gives the greenish tint to `Whey`. 

##### Enzymes - The Heroes of Cheesemaking

Enzymes are named after the substance they acto on and usually end with the suffix `ase`. `Lipases` are enzymes that break down `lipids`, aka fats. `Proteases` (aka prteinases) break down proteins. These two enzyme groups are the most important to cheesemakers. 

`Lipase` is present in milk, and is called `native` or `milk lipase`. `Native milk lipase` is mostly destroyed by pasteurization, while `lipase` produced by microorganisms usually survives the heat treatment.

The breakdown of the fat molecules in milk is something that the cheesemaker wants to happen at the appropriate time, which is usually during aging. If the breakdown of fats happens at the wrong time, rancid/off flavors can enter the cheese.

`Proteases` also occur naturally in milk, like `Lipase`. These are mostly destroyed by pasteurization, but additional proteases are provided by the use of rennet and starter culture bacteria. This process helps develop flavor and texture of the cheese, and can only occur in the vat and on the aging shelf.

##### Culture

Milk is a nutritious environment attractive to many different types of microorganisms, some which we want, and others that we don't. When using raw milk for cheesemaking, there will already be some bacteria in the milk, but added culture is still important. If using pasteurized milk, choosing and using cultures becomes even more critical. 

The role of `culture` is to help transform milk into cheese. Cultures are usually bacteria, but they can also be yeasts and molds. When they enter the story, they rapidly begin to consume the milk sugar (lactose) and turn it into lactic acid. It is this acid that will preserve the cheese during aging or stage, as well as create flavor. 

The second role of cultures is to die, as when this happens, their cell walls leave behind enzymes that will further break down proteins and fats into tasty elements.

Finally, cultures help create surfaces that textures that make cheeses unique. 

The term `Cheese Culture` covers three main types of organisms - bacteria, yeasts and molds. 

Some of these are added to the milk (starter culture), some exist in the milk or enter it accidentally (native culture), and others are aded at varying stages of the process (ripening cultures).
